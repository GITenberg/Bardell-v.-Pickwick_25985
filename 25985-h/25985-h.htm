1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>There are few things more familiar or more interesting to the
public than this <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>.&nbsp; It is
better known than many a real case: for every one knows the
Judge, his name and remarks&mdash;also the Counsel&mdash;(notably
Sergeant Buzfuz)&mdash;the witnessess, and what they
said&mdash;and of course all about the Plaintiff and the famous
Defendant.&nbsp; It was tried over seventy years ago at
&ldquo;the Guildhall Settens,&rdquo; and was described by Boz
some sixty-three years ago.&nbsp; Yet every detail seems
fresh&mdash;and as fresh as ever.&nbsp; It is astonishing that a
purely technical sketch like this, whose humours might be
relished only by such specialists as Barristers and Attorneys,
who would understand the jokes levelled at the Profession, should
be so well understanded of the people.&nbsp; All see the point of
the legal satire.&nbsp; It is a quite a prodigy.&nbsp; Boz had
the art, in an extraordinary degree, of thus vividly commending
trade processes, professional allusions, and methods to
outsiders, and making them humourous and intelligible.&nbsp;
Witness Jackson, when he came to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick
and friends with the <i>subp&oelig;nas</i>.&nbsp; It is a dry,
business-like process, but how racy Boz made it.&nbsp; A joke
sparkles in every line.</p>
<p>This trial for Breach has been debated over and over <!-- page
2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>again
among lawyers and barristers, some contending that &ldquo;there
was no evidence at all to go to the Jury&rdquo; as to a promise;
others insisting on mis-direction, and that there was evidence
that ought not to have been admitted.&nbsp; The law has since
been changed, and by later Acts both Mrs. Bardell and Mr.
Pickwick would have been allowed to tell their stories and to
have been cross-examined.&nbsp; Mrs. Bardell was almost justified
in supposing that Mr. Pickwick was offering his hand when he was
merely speaking of engaging a man-servant.&nbsp; But then the
whole would have been spoiled.&nbsp; Under the present systems,
this would all have come out.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick, when it came to
his turn, would have explained what his proceedings meant.&nbsp;
It is a most perfect and vivid satire on the hackneyed methods of
the lawyers when dealing with the witnesses.&nbsp; Nothing can be
more natural or more graphic.&nbsp; It is maintained to something
between the level of comedy and farce: nor is there the least
exaggeration.&nbsp; It applies now as it did then, though not to
the same topics.&nbsp; A hectoring, bullying Counsel, threatening
and cruel, would interfere with the pleasant tone of the play;
but it is all the same conveyed.&nbsp; There is a likeness to
Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick in another Burlesque case, tried in
our day, the well-known &ldquo;Trial by Jury,&rdquo; the joint
work of Mr. Gilbert and the late Sir Arthur Sullivan.&nbsp; The
general tone of both is the same and in the modern work there is
a general Pickwickian flavour.&nbsp; Sir Arthur&rsquo;s music,
too, is highly &ldquo;Pickwickian,&rdquo; and the joint effort of
the two humorists is infinitely diverting.&nbsp; The Judge is
something of a Stareleigh.</p>
<p>The truth is that Boz, the engenderer of these faceti&aelig;,
apart from his literary gift, was one of the most brilliant,
capable young fellows of his generation.&nbsp; Whatever he did,
he did in the best way, and in the brightest way.&nbsp; But his
power of observation and of <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>seeing what
might be termed the humorous <i>quiddity</i> of anything, was
extraordinary.</p>
<p>To put absurdity in a proper view for satirical purposes, it
has to be generalised from a number of instances, familiar to
all.&nbsp; Those legal oddities, the public had seen over and
over again, but they had passed unnoticed till this clever
observer set to work and noted them.&nbsp; As I say, it required
a deep knowledge of the law to set these things in a grotesque
light.</p>
<p>Boz had been a sort of general reporter on the
<i>Chronicle</i>: he &ldquo;took&rdquo; everything.&nbsp; He had
reported at police courts as well as at the law courts.&nbsp; His
quick and bright intelligence seized the humours here, as it did
those of the street.&nbsp; He later reported in the Gallery, and
was dispatched across country in post-chaises to
&ldquo;take&rdquo; eminent political speakers&mdash;always
winning the hearty commendation of his employers for his zeal and
energy.</p>
<h2><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>THE CAUSE OF ACTION.</h2>
<p>Mr. Pickwick was a well-to-do bachelor, who lived by himself
near the city, where he had been in trade.&nbsp; His age was
about fifty, as can be accurately calculated by his remark on the
sliding at Manor Farm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used to do so on the
gutters when I was a boy . . . but I hav&rsquo;nt done such a
thing these thirty years.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was said in
1828.&nbsp; He resided in Goswell Street&mdash;now Goswell
Road&mdash;with a widow lady, whose husband had been in the
Excise.&nbsp; He cannot have paid more than a pound a week, if so
much, for two rooms on the first floor.&nbsp; There was no
servant, and the hardworking landlady, Mrs. Martha Bardell,
performed all the duties of her household single-handed.&nbsp; As
her Counsel later described it,&mdash;and see all she did for
him!&mdash;&ldquo;She waited on him, attended to his comforts,
cooked his meals, looked out his linen for the washer-woman when
it went abroad, darned, aired, and prepared it for his wear when
it came home, and, in short, enjoyed his fullest trust and
confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Sergeant Buzfuz, duly
&ldquo;instructed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only was there Mr. Pickwick,
but there was another lodger, and her little boy Tommy.&nbsp; The
worthy woman took care of and looked after all three.&nbsp; This
might incline us to take a favorable view of her.&nbsp; She
regarded her lodger with feelings of veneration and attachment,
of which proof is found in her later talk with Sam.&nbsp; To him
she said that &ldquo;he had always behaved himself like a perfect
gentlemen,&rdquo; and then added this significant speech:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing to be dragged in this <!--
page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>way
before the public, but <i>I now see</i> that it&rsquo;s the only
thing that I ought to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, she seems to have
held out as long as possible, believing that her amiable lodger
would act as a perfect gentlemen and like himself.&nbsp; But when
she found that even an action had no terrors for him, she saw
that there was nothing else to do but to let the action go
on.</p>
<p>And what was Mrs. Bardell like?&nbsp; One would imagine her a
plump, buxom widow, &ldquo;fat, fair, and forty,&rdquo; with her
dear little boy, &ldquo;the only pledge of her deceased
exciseman,&rdquo; or say something between thirty and forty years
old.&nbsp; Fortunately, two portraits have come down to us of the
lady&mdash;one somewhat of this pattern, and depicting her, as
she flung herself on Mr. Pickwick on that disastrous morning: the
other&mdash;a swollen, dreadful thing, which must be a caricature
of the literal presentment.&nbsp; Here we see a woman of gross,
enormous proportions seated on the front bench and apparently
weighing some thirteen or fourteen stone, with a vast coarse
face.&nbsp; This is surely an unfair presentment of the worthy
landlady; besides, Dodson and Fogg were too astute practitioners
to imperil their chances by exhibiting to his Lordship and the
Jury so ill-favoured a plaintiff.&nbsp; Indeed, we are told that
they arranged a rather theatrical exhibition in this scene, with
a view of creating an impression in their favour.</p>
<p>Many find pleasure in reading the Bookseller&rsquo;s
Catalogues, and a vast number are showered on me in the course of
the year.&nbsp; But on one of these I always gaze with a special
interest, and even tenderness.&nbsp; For it comes from one
Herbert, who lives in Goswell Road.&nbsp; Only think,
<i>Goswell</i> Road&mdash;erst Goswell Street, where just seventy
years ago Mrs. Bardell was letting lodgings and Mr. Pickwick
himself was lodging: and on the cover I read, furthur attraction,
&ldquo;Goswell Road, near the &lsquo;Angel,&rsquo;&rdquo; whence
the &ldquo;stage&rdquo; which took the party <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>to the
&ldquo;Spaniard&rdquo; at Hampstead started!&nbsp; Sometimes I am
drawn to the shop, crowded with books; but one&rsquo;s thoughts
stray away from the books into speculations as to <i>which</i>
house it was.&nbsp; But the indications are most vague, though
the eye settles on a decent range of shabby-looking faded
tenements&mdash;two storeys high only&mdash;and which <i>look</i>
like lodging houses.&nbsp; Some ingenious commentators have
indeed ventured to identify the house itself, arguing from the
very general description in the text.</p>
<p>We should note, however, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s lack of
caution.&nbsp; He came in the very next day, having apparently
made no enquiries as to the landlady.&nbsp; Had he done so, he
would have learned of the drunken exciseman who met his death by
being knocked on the head with a quart pot.&nbsp; He might have
heard of the friends, Cluppins, Raddle, etc., who seemed to have
been charwomen or something of the sort; also that there was a
sort of working man as a fellow lodger.&nbsp; Above all, that
there was no servant in the house.&nbsp; All which boded ill, and
made it likely that Mr. Pickwick would be the easy victim of some
crafty scheme.</p>
<p>All went well until the unluckly morning in July, 1827, when
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s friends, coming to pay a morning call, and
entering unexpectedly, surprised Mr. Pickwick with his landlady
fainting in his arms in an hysterical condition.&nbsp; This was a
very awkward business.&nbsp; The delinquent, however, did not at
once grasp the situation, and could not &ldquo;make head or tail
of it, or what the lady meant.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friends, however,
had their doubts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What <i>is</i> the matter?&rsquo; said the
three tongue-tied Pickwickians.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Mr. Pickwick,
pettishly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, help me, lead this woman down
stairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am better now,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell,
faintly.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&lsquo;Let me lead you downstairs,&rsquo; said the ever
gallant Mr. Tupman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir&mdash;thank you?&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Bardell hysterically.&nbsp; And downstairs she was led
accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p7b.jpg">
<img alt="The cause of action" src="images/p7s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I cannot conceive&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, when his friend returned&mdash;&lsquo;I cannot conceive
what has been the matter with that woman.&nbsp; I had merely
announced to her my intention of keeping a man servant, when she
fell into the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found
her.&nbsp; Very extraordinary thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said his three friends.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&lsquo;Placed me in such an extremely awkward
situation,&rsquo; continued Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very,&rsquo; was the reply of his followers, as they
coughed slightly, and looked dubiously at each other.</p>
<p>This behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; He
remarked their incredulity.&nbsp; They evidently suspected
him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be reasonably supposed that Mr. Pickwick had not been
very discreet, or sufficiently cautious in his general behaviour
to his landlady.&nbsp; As we know, he was rather too effusive in
his relations with the fair sex.&nbsp; One of his weaknesses was
<i>kissing</i>.&nbsp; He would kiss everybody who was young or
good-looking.&nbsp; His maxim was &ldquo;Kiss early and kiss
often.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can forget his <i>systematic</i> method
of greeting the engaging Arabella?&nbsp; &ldquo;He (1) took off
his spectacles, (2) in great haste, and (3) taking both the young
lady&rsquo;s hands in his (4) kissed her (5) a great many times
(6) perhaps a greater number of times than was absolutely
necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Old rogue!&nbsp; I have little doubt that
on his return home from his tours he encircled the buxom figure
of Mrs. Bardell&mdash;all of course in his own paternal and
privileged way.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind also that Mr. Pickwick was almost
invariably drawn into his more serious scrapes and embarrassments
by this devotion to the sex.&nbsp; The night in the boarding
school garden&mdash;the affair with the spinster lady&mdash;his
interview with Arabella from the top of the wall&mdash;his
devotion to Mrs. Pott and Mrs. Dowler&mdash;and much more that we
do not hear of, show that he was a gallant elderly
gentleman.&nbsp; Oh, he was a &ldquo;sly dog, he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a curious burst of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s which seems
to hint at a sort of tender appreciation on his side.&nbsp; When
the notice of trial was sent to him, in his first vehemence, he
broke out that Mrs. Bardell had nothing <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>to do with the
business, &ldquo;<i>She hadn&rsquo;t the heart to do
it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick could not speak with this
certainty, unless he knew the lady&rsquo;s feelings pretty
well.&nbsp; <i>Why</i> hadn&rsquo;t she the heart to do it?&nbsp;
Because she was sincerely attached to him and his interests and
was &ldquo;a dear creature.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, however, was a
fond delusion of the worthy gentleman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Persons of
her class are not quite so disinterested as they appear to be,
especially if they have to interpret the various paternal and
comforting advances made to them by their well to do lodgers.</p>
<p>There is another factor which can hardly be left out, when
considering Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s responsibility&mdash;that is,
his too frequent indulgence in liquor, and the insufficiency of
his head to stand its influence.&nbsp; Now this was a very
important day for him, the first time he was to set up a man
servant.&nbsp; He had to break it to his landlady, who would
naturally resent the change.&nbsp; He may have been
<i>priming</i> himself with some of those perpetual glasses of
brandy and water to which he was addicted, and who knows but
that, in his ardour to propitiate, he may have gone a
<i>little</i> too far?&nbsp; This fact too, of the introducing a
man servant into her establishment, Mrs. Bardell may have
indistinctly associated with a general change in his life.&nbsp;
If she were to become Mrs. Pickwick her duties might be naturally
expected to devolve on a male assistant.</p>
<p>Next morning he and his friends quitted London on their
travels to Eatanswill in pursuit of adventure.&nbsp; He airily
dismissed the matter.&nbsp; We may wonder whether he made any
remonstrance to his landlady before his departure.&nbsp; Probably
he did not, fancying that she had been merely in a slight fit of
the &ldquo;tantrums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Bury, however, after the boarding-school adventure, he was
to be painfully awakened.&nbsp; He was sitting with his friends
after dinner at the &ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; in his happiest
mood.&nbsp; Winkle had related his quarrel with <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Pott <i>in
re</i> Mrs. Pott, in a humorous fashion when one of the most
delightful of humorous scenes followed.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick was proceeding with his scathing rebuke, when Sam
enters with a letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know this hand,&rsquo; said
Mr. Pickwick, opening the letter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mercy on us!
what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; It must be a jest;
it&mdash;it&mdash;can&rsquo;t be true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; was the general
inquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody dead, is there?&rsquo; said Wardle, alarmed at
the horror in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s countenance.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick made no reply, but, pushing the letter across the
table, and desiring Mr. Tupman to read it aloud, fell back in his
chair with a look of vacant astonishment quite alarming to
behold.</p>
<p>Mr. Tupman, with a trembling voice, read the letter, of which
the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>Freeman&rsquo;s Court</i>,
<i>Cornhill</i>, <i>August</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1827.<br />
<i>Bardell against Pickwick</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>
<p><i>Having been instructed by Mrs. Martha Bardell to commence
an action against you for a breach of promise of marriage</i>,
<i>for which the plaintiff lays her damages at fifteen hundred
pounds</i>, <i>we beg to inform you that a writ has been issued
against you in this suit in the Court of Common Pleas</i>; <i>and
request to know</i>, <i>by return of post</i>, <i>the name of
your attorney in London</i>, <i>who will accept service
thereof</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>We are</i>, <i>Sir</i>,<br />
<i>Your obedient servants</i>,<br />
<i>DODSON &amp; FOGG</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Pickwick.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Mr. Pickwick, the general mentor, the philosopher and
friend&mdash;the man of high moral tone, &ldquo;born to set the
world aright&rdquo;&mdash;the general lecturer of his
&ldquo;followers,&rdquo; was now in for an action at law of the
most awkward and unpleasant kind.&nbsp; To be philandering <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>with one&rsquo;s landlady! rather low form this.&nbsp;
But what would they say down at Manor Farm?&nbsp; How Isabella
Wardle and her sister&mdash;and all the girls&mdash;would
laugh!&nbsp; And the spinster aunt&mdash;<i>she</i> would enjoy
it!&nbsp; But there was no help for it.&nbsp; It must be
faced.</p>
<p>Naturally Mr. Pickwick felt uncomfortable, and his first idea
was to arrange the matter.&nbsp; This was a sensible course, and
he ought at once to have put the matter into the hands of his
friend Perker, with full powers to treat.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s vanity and indiscretion made him meddle in the
business behind his solicitor&rsquo;s back, as it where, and with
damaging results to himself&mdash;a warning to all such
amateurs.&nbsp; It must be said that Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s
behaviour at the extraordinary visit which he paid them was
marked by a certain propriety.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick insisted on
knowing what were the grounds of action&mdash;that is, the
details of the evidence against him&mdash;in short, their
case.&nbsp; They, very correctly, refused to tell him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The case may be false or it may be true&mdash;it may be
credible it may be incredible.&rdquo;&nbsp; But all the same it
was a strong case.&nbsp; This was as much as they could
tell.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick could only urge that if &ldquo;it were
so, he was a most unfortunate man,&rdquo; on which Dodson
promptly&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you are, sir, I trust you may be,
sir.&nbsp; If you are really innocent, you are more unfortunate
than I had believed any man could possibly be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick then rather foolishly asked did he understand
they meant to go on with the action&mdash;as if they could have
been affected by his declaration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Understand?&rdquo;
was the reply, &ldquo;that you certainly may&rdquo;&mdash;a very
natural speech.</p>
<p>With some want of professional delicacy and etiquette, Dodson
seized the opportunity to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick; but
they were not a high-class firm and their methods were not
high-class.&nbsp; Then an extraordinarily <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>incredible
display followed.&nbsp; His passion broke forth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings he
ever</i>, <i>etc.</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dodson summoned his clerks to
listen to this gross language, and said, &ldquo;Perhaps you would
like to call us swindlers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You
are</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; Fogg even wished him to
assault them&mdash;and perhaps he would have done so, but for
Sam, who at last got him away.&nbsp; This was certainly not
correct, but how aggravating was Mr. Pickwick!&nbsp; One is
rather astonished at the forbearance of this sharp firm.</p>
<p>Now, had Mr. Pickwick gone straight to his lodgings in Goswell
Street and seen Mrs. Bardell, heard her views and claims, had he
been told by her that she had been professionally urged to go to
law as she had such a strong case&mdash;there might have been
some excuse for this violence to Dodson and Fogg.&nbsp; But he
knew nothing whatever of the matter&mdash;knew nothing of the
attornies&mdash;and in his blind fury gratuitously assumed that
they had &ldquo;conspired&rdquo; to harass him in this way.&nbsp;
True, he had overheard how they had treated poor Ramsey.</p>
<p>This very <i>malapropos</i> visit of Mr. Pickwick to the firm
was, as I said, a mistake and damaged his case.&nbsp; It showed
that he was nervous and anxious, and <i>insecure</i>.&nbsp; He
took nothing by it.&nbsp; There was in truth much short-sighted
cunning in his ways, which came of his overweening vanity.&nbsp;
But this was only one of several attempts he made to worm out
something to his own advantage.</p>
<p>Another of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s foolish man&oelig;uvres was
his sending his man to his old lodgings to his
landlady&mdash;ostensibly to fetch away his &ldquo;things,&rdquo;
when this dialogue passed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Tell Mrs. Bardell she may put a bill up, as
soon as she likes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wery good, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller;
&lsquo;anythin&rsquo; more, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&lsquo;Nothing more, Sam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Weller stepped slowly to the door, as if he expected
something more; slowly opened it, slowly stepped out, and had
slowly closed it within a couple of inches, when Mr. Pickwick
called out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, stepping quickly back, and
closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no objection, Sam, to your endeavouring to
ascertain how Mrs. Bardell herself seems disposed towards me, and
whether it is really probable that this vile and groundless
action is to be carried to extremity.&nbsp; <i>I say</i>, <i>I do
not object to your doing this</i>, <i>if you wish it</i>,
<i>Sam</i>,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; Sam gave a short nod
of intelligence and left the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this was very artful on the part of Mr. Pickwick, but it
was a very shallow sort of artfulness, and it was later to recoil
on himself.&nbsp; Sam of course saw through it at once.&nbsp; It
never dawned on this simple-minded man what use the
Plaintiff&rsquo;s solicitors would make of his
<i>demarche</i>.</p>
<p>When the subp&oelig;nas were served he rushed off to
Perker:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;They have subp&oelig;na&rsquo;d my servant
too,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam?&rsquo; said Perker.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, my dear sir; of course.&nbsp; I knew they
would.&nbsp; I could have told <i>you</i> that a month ago.&nbsp;
You know, my dear sir, if you <i>will</i> take the management of
your affairs into your own hands after intrusting them to your
solicitor, you must also take the consequences.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here
Mr. Perker drew himself up with conscious dignity, and brushed
some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&lsquo;And what do they want him to prove?&rsquo; asked
Mr. Pickwick, after two or three minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you sent him up to the plaintiff&rsquo;s to make
some offer of a compromise, I suppose,&rsquo; replied
Perker.&nbsp; &lsquo;It don&rsquo;t matter much, though; I
don&rsquo;t think many counsel could get a great deal out of
<i>him</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they could,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minuti&aelig; of legal process are prosaic and
uninteresting, and it might seem impossible to invest them with
any dramatic interest; but how admirably has Boz lightened up and
coloured the simple incident of an attorney&rsquo;s clerk&mdash;a
common, vulgar fellow of the lowest type, arriving to serve his
subp&oelig;nas on the witnesses&mdash;all assumed to be
hostile.&nbsp; The scene is full of touches of light comedy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;How de do, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson,
nodding to Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>That gentlemen bowed, and looked somewhat surprised for the
physiognomy of Mr. Jackson dwelt not in his recollection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have called from Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said
Mr. Jackson, in an explanatory tone.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick roused at the name.&nbsp; &lsquo;I refer you to
my attorney, sir: Mr. Perker, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Waiter, show this gentleman out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Jackson,
deliberately depositing his hat on the floor, and drawing from
his pocket the strip of parchment.&nbsp; &lsquo;But personal
service, by clerk or agent, in these cases, you know, Mr.
Pickwick&mdash;nothing like caution, sir, in all legal
forms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Jackson cast his eye on the parchment; and, resting
his hands on the table, and looking round with a winning and
persuasive, smile, said: &lsquo;Now, come; don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s have no words about such a little matter as
this.&nbsp; Which of you gentlemen&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s
Snodgrass?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this inquiry Mr. Snodgrass gave such a very undisguised
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>and palpable start, that no further reply was
needed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I thought so,&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson, more affably
than before.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little something to
trouble you with, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a <i>subp&oelig;na</i> in Bardell and
Pickwick on behalf of the plaintiff,&rsquo; replied Jackson,
singling out one of the slips of paper, and producing a shilling
from his waistcoat pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll come on, in
the settens after Term; fourteenth of Febooary, we expect;
we&rsquo;ve marked it a special jury cause, and it&rsquo;s only
ten down the paper.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s yours, Mr.
Snodgrass.&rsquo;&nbsp; As Jackson said this he presented the
parchment before the eyes of Mr. Snodgrass, and slipped the paper
and the shilling into his hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment,
when Jackson, turning sharply upon him, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I ain&rsquo;t mistaken when I say your
name&rsquo;s Tupman, am I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no
encouragement in that gentleman&rsquo;s widely-opened eyes to
deny his name, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my name <i>is</i> Tupman, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that other gentleman&rsquo;s Mr. Winkle, I
think?&rsquo; said Jackson.</p>
<p>Mr. Winkle faltered out a reply in the affirmative; and both
gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper, and a
shilling each, by the dexterous Mr. Jackson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Jackson, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m affraid
you&rsquo;ll think me rather troublesome, but I want somebody
else, if it ain&rsquo;t inconvenient.&nbsp; I <i>have</i> Samuel
Weller&rsquo;s name here, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send my servant here, waiter,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>The waiter retired, considerably
astonished, and Mr. Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat.</p>
<p>There was a painful pause, which was at length broken by the
innocent defendant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, his
indignation rising while he spoke; &lsquo;I suppose, sir, that it
is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon
the testimony of my own friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the
left side of his nose, to intimate that he was not there to
disclose the secrets of the prison-house, and playfully
rejoined:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not knowin&rsquo;, can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For what other reason, sir,&rsquo; pursued Mr.
Pickwick, &lsquo;are these subp&oelig;nas served upon them, if
not for this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; replied Jackson,
slowly shaking his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it won&rsquo;t
do.&nbsp; No harm in trying, but there&rsquo;s little to be got
out of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Jackson smiled once more upon the company, and,
applying his left thumb to the tip of his nose, worked a
visionary coffee-mill with his right hand: thereby performing a
very graceful piece of pantomime (then much in vogue, but now,
unhappily, almost obsolete) which was familiarly denominated
&lsquo;taking a grinder.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Imagine a modern
solicitor&rsquo;s clerk &ldquo;Taking a grinder!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Jackson, in
conclusion; &lsquo;Perker&rsquo;s people must guess what we
served these subp&oelig;nas for.&nbsp; If they can&rsquo;t, they
must wait till the action comes on, and then they&rsquo;ll find
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his
unwelcome visitor, and would probably have hurled some tremendous
anathema at the heads of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, had not
Sam&rsquo;s entrance at the instant interrupted him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Samuel Weller?&rsquo; said Mr. Jackson,
inquiringly.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&lsquo;Vun o&rsquo; the truest things as you&rsquo;ve
said for many a long year,&rsquo; replied Sam, in a most composed
manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a subp&oelig;na for you, Mr.
Weller,&rsquo; said Jackson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that in English?&rsquo; inquired Sam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the original,&rsquo; said Jackson,
declining the required explanation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which?&rsquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This,&rsquo; replied Jackson, shaking the
parchment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the &rsquo;rig&rsquo;nal, is
it?&rsquo; said Sam.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m wery glad
I&rsquo;ve seen the &rsquo;rig&rsquo;nal, &rsquo;cos it&rsquo;s a
gratifyin&rsquo; sort o&rsquo; thing, and eases vun&rsquo;s mind
so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s the shilling,&rsquo; said
Jackson.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s from Dodson and
Fogg&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s uncommon handsome o&rsquo; Dodson and
Fogg, as knows so little of me, to come down vith a
present,&rsquo; said Sam.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feel it as a wery high
compliment, sir; it&rsquo;s a wery hon&rsquo;rable thing to them,
as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it.&nbsp;
Besides wich, it&rsquo;s affectin to one&rsquo;s
feelin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Weller said this, he inflicted a little friction on his
right eye-lid, with the sleeve of his coat, after the most
approved manner of actors when they are in domestic
pathetics.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson seemed rather puzzled by Sam&rsquo;s proceedings;
but, as he had served the subp&oelig;nas, and had nothing more to
say, he made a feint of putting on the one glove which he usually
carried in his hand, for the sake of appearances; and returned to
the office to report progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s foolish and self-willed
proceedings was the interview with Serjeant Snubbin, which he so
positively insisted upon.&nbsp; We may wonder now-a-days would
any K.C. of position have condescended to allow such a
proceeding?&nbsp; I fancy it would be thought
&ldquo;irregular:&rdquo; though perhaps <i>ex gratia</i>, and
from the oddity of the proposal, it might be conceded.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>When Mr. Pickwick called upon him, it turned out that
the Serjeant knew nothing whatever of his case; probably cared
nothing about it.&nbsp; It was not in his line.&nbsp; He perhaps
wondered why the old-fashioned lawyer had &ldquo;retained&rdquo;
him.&nbsp; We learn Parker&rsquo;s reason:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve done everything
that&rsquo;s necessary.&nbsp; I have engaged Serjeant
Snubbin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he a good man?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good man!&rsquo; replied Perker; &lsquo;bless your
heart and soul, my dear sir, Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top
of his profession.&nbsp; Gets treble the business of any man in
court&mdash;engaged in every case.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t
mention it abroad; but we say&mdash;we of the
profession&mdash;that Serjeant Snubbin leads the court by the
nose.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How foolish was this reasoning can be seen on an
instant&rsquo;s reflection.&nbsp; To &ldquo;lead the court by the
nose&rdquo; is well enough in an argument before a judge: but
here it was more important to lead <i>a jury</i> by the nose,
which Buzfuz knew how to do.&nbsp; Moreover when a counsel has
this power, it usually operates on a special judge and his
colleagues; but who could guarantee that Snubbin&rsquo;s special
judge would try the case.&nbsp; As it turned out, the Chief
Justice fell sick before the day, and Mr. Justice Stareleigh
unexpectedly took the case.&nbsp; He as it proved was anything
but &ldquo;led by the nose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perker indeed, summed up
the whole weakness of the case in a single sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;They have subp&oelig;na&rsquo;d my three
friends,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! of course they would,&rsquo; replied Perker.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Important witnesses; saw you in a delicate
situation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she fainted of her own accord,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; &lsquo;She threw herself into my arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely, my dear sir,&rsquo; replied Perker;
&lsquo;very likely and very natural.&nbsp; Nothing more so, my
dear sir, nothing.&nbsp; <i>But who&rsquo;s to prove
it</i>?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>A suggestion, we are told, that rather
&ldquo;staggered&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes after he had received the assurance that
the thing was impossible, he was conducted by his solicitors into
the outer office of the great Serjeant Snubbin himself.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions,
with a large writing table drawn up near the fire, the baize top
of which had long since lost all claim to its original hue of
green, and had gradually grown grey with dust and age, except
where all traces of its natural colour were obliterated by
ink-stains.&nbsp; Upon the table were numerous little bundles of
papers tied with red tape; and behind it, sat an elderly clerk,
whose sleek appearance and heavy gold watch-chain presented
imposing indications of the extensive and lucrative practice of
Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the Serjeant in his room, Mr. Mallard?&rsquo;
inquired Perker, offering his box with all imaginable
courtesy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he is,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s
very busy.&nbsp; Look here; not an opinion given yet, on any one
of these cases; and an expedition fee paid with all of
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; The clerk smiled as he said this, and inhaled
the pinch of snuff with a zest which seemed to be compounded of a
fondness for snuff and a relish for fees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something like practice that,&rsquo; said Perker.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the barrister&rsquo;s clerk, producing
his own box, and offering it with the greatest cordiality;
&lsquo;and the best of it is, that as nobody alive except myself
can read the Serjeant&rsquo;s writing, they are obliged to wait
for the opinions, when he has given them, till I have copied
&rsquo;em, ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which makes good for we know who, besides the Serjeant,
and draws a little more out of his clients, eh?&rsquo; said
Perker; &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;&nbsp; At this the
Serjeant&rsquo;s clerk laughed again&mdash;not a noisy boisterous
laugh, but <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>a silent, internal chuckle, which Mr.
Pickwick disliked to hear.&nbsp; When a man bleeds inwardly, it
is a dangerous thing for himself; but when he laughs inwardly, it
bodes no good to other people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t made me out that little list of the
fees that I&rsquo;m in your debt, have you?&rsquo; said
Perker.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I have not,&rsquo; replied the clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would,&rsquo; said Perker.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let
me have them, and I&rsquo;ll send you a cheque.&nbsp; But I
suppose you&rsquo;re too busy pocketing the ready money, to think
of the debtors, eh? ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;&nbsp; This sally seemed to
tickle the clerk, amazingly, and he once more enjoyed a little
quiet laugh to himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Mallard, my dear friend,&rsquo; said Perker,
suddenly recovering his gravity, and drawing the great
man&rsquo;s great man into a corner, by the lappel of his coat,
&lsquo;you must persuade the Serjeant to see me, and my client
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said the clerk, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
not bad either.&nbsp; See the Serjeant! come, that&rsquo;s too
absurd.&rsquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the absurdity of the
proposal, however, the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn
beyond the hearing of Mr. Pickwick; and after a short
conversation conducted in whispers, walked softly down a little
dark passage and disappeared into the legal luminary&rsquo;s
sanctum, from whence he shortly returned on tiptoe, and informed
Mr. Perker and Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed
upon, in violation of all his established rules and customs, to
admit them at once.</p>
<p>The Serjeant was writing when his clients entered; he bowed
abstractedly when Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor;
and then, motioning them to a seat, put his pen carefully in the
inkstand, nursed his left leg, and waited to be spoken to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Pickwick is the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick,
Serjeant Snubbin,&rsquo; said Perker.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am retained in that, am I?&rsquo; said the
Serjeant.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&lsquo;You are, Sir,&rsquo; replied Perker.</p>
<p>The Serjeant nodded his head, and waited for something
else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Pickwick was anxious to call upon you, Serjeant
Snubbin,&rsquo; said Perker, &lsquo;to state to you, before you
entered upon the case, that he denies there being any ground or
pretence whatever for the action against him; and that unless he
came into court with clean hands, and without the most
conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting the
plaintiff&rsquo;s demand, he would not be there at all.&nbsp; I
believe I state your views correctly; do I not, my dear
Sir?&rsquo; said the little man, turning to Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; replied that gentleman.</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses, raised them to his
eyes; and, after looking at Mr. Pickwick for a few seconds with
great curiosity, turned to Mr. Perker, and said, smiling slightly
as he spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Mr. Pickwick a strong case?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The attorney shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you purpose calling witnesses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The smile on the Serjeant&rsquo;s countenance became more
defined; he rocked his leg with increased violence, and, throwing
himself back in his easy-chair, coughed dubiously.</p>
<p>These tokens of the Serjeant&rsquo;s presentiments on the
subject, slight as they were, were not lost on Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; He settled the spectacles, through which he had
attentively regarded such demonstrations of the barrister&rsquo;s
feeling as he had permitted himself to exhibit, more firmly on
his nose; and said with great energy, and in utter disregard of
all Mr. Perker&rsquo;s admonitory winkings and
frownings&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My wishing to wait upon you for such a purpose as this,
Sir, appears, I have no doubt, to a gentleman <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>who sees so
much of these matters as you must necessarily do, a very
extraordinary circumstance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire, but the smile
came back again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p22b.jpg">
<img alt="Mr. Pickwick expounds his case to his Counsel"

</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Gentlemen of your profession, Sir,&rsquo;
continued Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;see the worst side of human
nature&mdash;all its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood,
rise up before you.&nbsp; You know from your experience of juries
(I mean no disparagement to you or them) how much depends <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>upon <i>effect</i>; and you are apt to attribute to
others, a desire to use, for purposes of deception and
self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty
and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your
utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well,
from constantly employing them yourselves.&nbsp; I really believe
that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very
general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful,
and over-cautious.&nbsp; Conscious as I am, Sir, of the
disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such
circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to
understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent
of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well
aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, Sir, I must
beg to add, that unless you sincerely believe this, I would
rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the
advantage of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Long before the close of this address, which we are bound to
say was of a very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick, the Serjeant
had relapsed into a state of abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the Serjeant might at once have replied to all this, that
the innocence or guilt of a client had nothing to do with him,
that his use was merely to secure a client such benefit and
advantage as the law entitled him to: that a judge and jury would
decide the point of innocence.&nbsp; Boz himself evidently shared
this popular delusion, and seems to be speaking by Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; The sagacious Serjeant, however,
took no notice whatever of the appeal, but simply asked
&ldquo;who was with him&rdquo; in the case.&nbsp; Mr. Phunky was
sent for, and asked by his leader &ldquo;to take Mr. Pickwick
away&rdquo; and &ldquo;hear anything he may wish to
communicate.&rdquo;&nbsp; The party was then bowed out.</p>
<p>The truth was, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s attorney was too much <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>of a social character and of the &ldquo;old family
solicitor&rdquo; pattern for so critical a case.&nbsp; The
counsel he &ldquo;instructed&rdquo; were unsuitable.&nbsp;
Serjeant Snubbin was an overworked &ldquo;Chamber lawyer,&rdquo;
whose whole time and experience was given to furnishing
&ldquo;opinions&rdquo; on tangled cases; so pressed was he that
he took &ldquo;expedition fees&rdquo; to give certain cases
priority: an illegitimate practice that now the Bar Committee
would scarcely tolerate.&nbsp; What could such a man know of nisi
prius trials, of cross-examining or handling witnesses?&nbsp; It
is enough to give his portrait, as supplied by the author:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p24.jpg">
<img alt="Serjeant Snubbin, K.C." src="images/p24.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was a lantern-faced,
sallow-complexioned man, of about five-and-forty, or&mdash;as the
novels say&mdash;he might be fifty.&nbsp; He had that
<i>dull-looking boiled eye</i> which is often to be seen in the
heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to
a weary and laborious course of study; and which would have been
sufficient, without the additional eye-glass which dangled from a
broad black riband round his neck, to warn a stranger that he was
very near-sighted.&nbsp; His hair was thin and weak, which was
partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its
arrangement, and partly to his having worn for five-and-twenty
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>years the forsenic wig which hung on a block beside
him.&nbsp; The marks of hair powder on his coat collar, and the
ill-washed and worse tied white neckerchief round his throat,
showed that he had not found leisure since he left the court to
make any alteration in his dress: while the slovenly style of the
remainder of his costume warranted the inference that his
personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he
had.&nbsp; Books of practice, heaps of papers, and opened
letters, were scattered over the table, without any attempt at
order or arrangement; the furniture of the room was old and
ricketty; the doors of the bookcase were rotting in their hinges;
the dust flew out from the carpet in little clouds at every step;
the blinds were yellow with age and dirt; the state of everything
in the room showed, with a clearness not to be mistaken, that Mr.
Serjeant Snubbin was far too much occupied with his professional
pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his personal
comforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a characteristic feature of the slowness of legal
process in those days that though the notice of action was sent
on August the 28th, 1827, the case was not ripe for trial until
February 14th of the next year&mdash;nearly six months having
elapsed.&nbsp; It is difficult to speculate as to what this long
delay was owing.&nbsp; There were only two witnesses whose
evidence had to be briefed&mdash;Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs.
Sanders&mdash;and they were at hand.&nbsp; It is odd, by the way,
that they did not think of examining little Tommy Bardell, the
only one who actually witnessed the proceeding.&nbsp; True, he
was of tender years&mdash;about eight or ten&mdash;and the son of
the Plaintiff, but he must have &ldquo;known the nature of an
oath.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>THE TRIAL.</h2>
<p>At last the momentous morning came round.&nbsp; It was the
fourteenth of February, Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 1828&mdash;one not
of good omen for the Plaintiff. <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; The
Defendant&rsquo;s party was rather gloomy at breakfast, when
Perker, by wave of encouraging his client, uttered some
<i>dicta</i> as to the chances of the Jury having had a good
breakfast &ldquo;Discontented or hungry jurymen, my dear Sir,
always find for the Plaintiff.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless my
heart,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank, &ldquo;What
do they do that for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party then got into hackney coaches and was driven to the
Guildhall, where the case was to be tried at ten o&rsquo;clock
precisely.</p>

</a></p>
<p>How dramatic Boz has made the &ldquo;calling of the
Jury,&rdquo; which might be thought an uninteresting and prosaic
operation enough.&nbsp; It was a special jury, which entailed one
guinea per head extra expense on Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; He had, of
course, asked for it: but Dodson and Fogg would have been well
content with and perhaps even have preferred a common jury.&nbsp;
Now-a-days, special jurors, though summoned largely, have to be
almost coerced into attending.&nbsp; A fine of ten pounds is
imposed, but this is almost invariably remitted on
affidavit.&nbsp; The common jurors, moreover, do not show the
reluctance to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; of Groffin, the chemist.&nbsp;
A guinea is not to be despised.&nbsp; There are, as it were,
professional common jurors who hang about the Courts in the hope
of being thus called as &ldquo;understudies.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this
occasion what was called a <i>Tales</i> was prayed for, and two
common jurors were pressed into the service: and &ldquo;a
greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to say too much of the completeness with
which the legal scene is put forward.&nbsp; Everything is dealt
with.&nbsp; We have perfect sketches of the judge, the ushers,
the jury, the counsel on the case, the witnesses, the barristers,
the attorneys; we have the speeches, the methods of examination
and cross-examination.</p>
<p>There is nothing better or more life-like than the sketch of
the court in the chill morning, and before the actors came on the
scene&mdash;the inimitable description of the idle barristers
hanging about &ldquo;the Bar of England,&rdquo; which is accurate
to this hour.</p>
<p>Few could describe effectively the peculiar appearance of a
crowd of barristers assembled in a Court of Law.&nbsp; They are a
type apart, and their odd headgear accentuates all the
peculiarities of their faces.&nbsp; No one has, however,
succeeded so well as Boz in touching off their
peculiarities.&nbsp; This sort of histrionic guise and bearing is
assumed with a view to impose on his friends and the public, to
suggest an idea that they have much or at least something to
do.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And that,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
pointing to a couple of enclosed seats on his right,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s where the jurymen sit, is it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The identical place, my dear Sir,&rsquo; replied
Perker, tapping the lid of his snuff-box.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Mr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation and
took a glance at the court.&nbsp; There were already a pretty
large sprinkling of spectators in the gallery, and a numerous
muster of gentlemen in wigs in the barristers&rsquo; seats, who
presented, as a body, all that pleasing and extensive variety of
nose and whisker for which the bar of England is so justly
celebrated.&nbsp; Such of the gentlemen as had got a brief to
carry, carried it in as conspicuous a manner as possible, and
occasionally scratched their noses therewith, to impress the fact
more strongly on the observation of the spectators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the happiest descriptions is surely that of the binding
of law books.&nbsp; A law library is the most repulsive and
uninteresting thing in the world.&nbsp; The colour of the leather
is unhealthy and disagreeable, and the necessary shading is
secured at the expense of grace.&nbsp; Boz characterises it as
&lsquo;that under-done pie crust.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Other gentlemen, who had no briefs to show,
carried under their arms goodly octavos, with a red label behind,
and that under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover, which is
technically known as &ldquo;law calf.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others, who
had neither briefs nor books, thrust their hands into their
pockets, and looked as wise as they conveniently could; while
others, again, moved here and there with great restlessness and
earnestness of manner, content to awaken thereby the admiration
and astonishment of the uninitiated stranger.&nbsp; The whole, to
the great wonderment of Mr. Pickwick, were divided into little
groups, who were chatting and discussing the news of the day in
the most unfeeling manner possible&mdash;just as if no trial at
all were coming on.</p>
<p>A bow from Mr. Phunky, as he entered, and took his seat behind
the row appropriated to the King&rsquo;s Counsel, attracted Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s attention; and he had scarcely returned it, when
Mr. Serjeant Snubbin appeared, followed by Mr. Mallard, who half
hid the Serjeant behind a large crimson bag, which he placed on
his table, and <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>after shaking hands with Perker,
withdrew.&nbsp; Then there entered two or three more Serjeants,
and among them, one with a fat body and a red face, who nodded in
a friendly manner to Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, and said it was a fine
morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that red-faced man, who said it was a fine
morning and nodded to our counsel?&rsquo; whispered Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz,&rsquo; replied Perker.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s opposed to us; he leads on the other
side.&nbsp; That gentleman behind him is Mr. Skimpin, his
junior.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick was just on the point of inquiring, with great
abhorrence of the man&rsquo;s cold-blooded villainy, how Mr.
Serjeant Buzfuz, who was counsel for the opposite party, dared to
presume to tell Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who was counsel for him,
that it was a fine morning,&mdash;when he was interrupted by a
general rising of the barristers, and a loud cry of
&lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; from the officers of the court.&nbsp;
Looking round, he found that this was caused by the entrance of
the Judge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On reaching the Court, Perker said, &ldquo;put Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s friends in the students&rsquo; box.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick had better sit by me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This useful provision
for the instruction of legal probationers has fallen into
desuetude&mdash;no place is reserved for the students
now-a-days.&nbsp; Lord Campbell describes the custom and recalls
an incident that occurred when he was sitting in the
students&rsquo; box, close to the Bench.</p>
<p>There were some matters of procedure which have since been
changed&mdash;such as Mr. Skimpin &ldquo;calling for&rdquo;
Winkle, and the latter answering.&nbsp; This is now done by an
Officer of the Court.&nbsp; Skimpin also asks Winkle his name, as
a first question, though he had been sworn and had given
it.&nbsp; And the <i>mal-entendu</i> as to &ldquo;Daniel
Nathaniel&rdquo; could not then have occurred, as the Officer
would have obtained the name correctly.&nbsp; Another unusual
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>thing was that Buzfuz, after his long and rather
exhausting speech, should have examined the first witness.&nbsp;
Now-a-days the junior would do this.&nbsp; We may note that at
this time it was always &ldquo;my Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;your
Lordship,&rdquo; with the full natural sound&mdash;we had not yet
got to the clipped &ldquo;M&rsquo;lud,&rsquo;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;your Ludship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps this form <i>was</i>
actually used by the Counsel but was not noticed by Boz, or
seemed to him the right thing.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s Counsel
were behind and could stoop down to consult their solicitors.</p>
<p>This minute observation and particularity of Boz is further
shown in his noting the very places where the Attorneys sat, and
which he describes.&nbsp; They had the seats next the table:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said Buzfuz later on,
answering the whisper of Dodson and Fogg, after Sam&rsquo;s
awkward revelation.&nbsp; How often have we seen these hasty
communications, which are not without their dramatic effect.</p>
<h2><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>THE JUDGE.</h2>
<p>Mr. Pickwick, unfortunate in his Counsel, his Solicitor, his
Jury&mdash;one of prejudiced tradesmen&mdash;was also to be
unlucky in the Judge who tried his case.&nbsp; No doubt Perker
had comforted him: &ldquo;no matter how it goes, however unfair
Buzfuz may be, we have a judge to hold the scales fair and keep
the jury straight.&nbsp; The Lord Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, the Right Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Nicholas Conyngham
Tindal</span> is a man of immense reputation at the Bar.&nbsp; We
are most fortunate in having him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Judge then of the
disappointment when on coming to court it was found that Sir
Stephen Gaselee was to take the case &ldquo;owing to the absence
of the Chief Justice, occasioned by indisposition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(I protest that at times one does not know whether we are
following out a course of real events, or tracing the incidents
of a fiction, so wonderfully does Boz make his fiction blend with
reality.)&nbsp; This was a serious blow.&nbsp; Tindal was an
admirable judge.&nbsp; Did not his chroniclers write of him:
&ldquo;His sagacity, impartiality and plain sense, his industry
and clear sightedness made him an admiration of non-professional
spectators: while among lawyers he was very highly esteemed
<i>for his invariable kindness to all who appeared before
him</i>.&nbsp; He retained to the last their respect and
affection.&rdquo;&nbsp; With such a man presiding Sergeant
Buzfuz&rsquo;s eccentric violence and abuse of the defendant
would have been restrained (&ldquo;having the outward appearance
of a man and not of a monster.&rdquo;)&nbsp; Mr. Skimpin&rsquo;s
gross insinuations, to wit, that Winkle <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>was
&ldquo;telegraphing&rdquo; to his friend, would have been
summarily put down, and all &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; checked; more,
he would have calmly kept Counsel&rsquo;s attention to the
issue.&nbsp; This perfect impartiality would have made him show
to the Jury how little evidence there was to support the
plaintiff&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; Instead came this unlucky
indisposition: and his place was taken by &ldquo;my Brother
Gaselee:&rdquo; with what results Mr. Pickwick was to learn
disastrously.</p>
<p>It is curious, however, that the Chief Justice, in spite of
his indisposition, should still be associated with the case; for
he had tried the momentous case of Norton <i>v.</i> Melbourne,
and had heard there letters read, which were parodied in the
&ldquo;chops and tomato sauce&rdquo; correspondence, so Boz had
him well before him.&nbsp; The case had to be tried at the
Guildhall Sessions; so a fair and rational judge would have
spoilt all sport.&nbsp; Further, as Boz had seen the fairness and
dignity of the Chief Justice he was naturally reluctant to
exhibit him unfavorably.&nbsp; The only thing was to make the
Chief Justice become suddenly &ldquo;indisposed,&rdquo; and have
his place taken by a grotesque judge.</p>
<p>The Judge who was to try the case, Mr. Justice Stareleigh, as
is well known, was drawn from Sir Stephen Gaselee, of whose name
Stareleigh is a sort of synonym.&nbsp; Serjeant Gaselee was once
well known in the prosecutions directed against Radicals and
so-called Reformers, but <i>Pickwick</i> has given him a greater
reputation.&nbsp; The baiting he received from patriotic
advocates may have inflamed his temper and made him
irritable.&nbsp; He is described by one author, in a most
humorous, if personal fashion.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;a most
particularly short man, and so fat that he seemed all face and
waistcoat.&nbsp; He rolled in upon two little turned legs, and
having bobbed gravely to the bar who bobbed gravely to him, put
his little legs under the table, when all you could see of <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>him was two queer little eyes, one broad, pink face, and
somewhere about half of a big and very comical-looking
wig.&rdquo;&nbsp; All through he is shown as arrogant and
incapable, and also as making some absurd mistakes.</p>
<p>It will be a surprise to most people to learn that this
picture is no more than an amusing caricature, and that the judge
was really a person of high character.&nbsp; He is described as
&ldquo;a very painstaking, upright judge, and, in his private
capacity, a worthy and benevolent man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, Mr.
Croker, who, however, supplies a sound reason for his being the
subject of such satire.&nbsp; &ldquo;With many admirable
qualities both of head and heart, he had made himself a
legitimate object of ridicule by his explosions on the
Bench.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under such conditions, the Bar, the suitors
and the public had neither the wish nor the opportunity to search
for extenuating excuses in his private life.&nbsp; They suffered
enough from the &ldquo;explosions&rdquo; and that was all that
concerned them.&nbsp; He had been fourteen years on the Bench,
and, like Stareleigh, belonged to the Common Pleas.&nbsp; He was
suffering too from infirmities, particularly from deafness, and
appears to have misapprehended statements in the same grotesque
fashion that he mistook Winkle&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Boz&rsquo;s fashion of burlesque, by the way, is happily shown
in his treatment of this topic.&nbsp; Another would have been
content with &ldquo;Daniel,&rdquo; the simple
misapprehension.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nathaniel, sir,&rdquo; says
Winkle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Daniel&mdash;any other name?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nathaniel, sir&mdash;my lord, I mean.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Nathaniel Daniel</i>&mdash;<i>or Daniel
Nathaniel</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, my lord, only Nathaniel,
not Daniel at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell me it was Daniel for, then,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, sir.&nbsp; <i>How could I have got Nathaniel
in my notes</i>, <i>unless you told me so</i>,
<i>sir</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How admirable is this.&nbsp; The sly satire goes deeper, as
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>Judges, under less gross conditions, have often made
this illogical appeal to &ldquo;my notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though not gifted with oratorical powers which were likely to
gain him employment as a leader, Gaselee&rsquo;s reputation for
legal knowledge soon recommended him to a judge&rsquo;s
place.&nbsp; He was accordingly selected on July 1st, 1824, to
fill a vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas.&nbsp; In that Court
he sat for nearly fourteen years &ldquo;with the character of a
painstaking judge, and in his private capacity as a worthy and
benevolent man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Mr. Foss, F.S.A.</p>
<p>The reader will have noted the Judge&rsquo;s severity to poor
Groffin, the chemist, who had pleaded the danger of his boy
mistaking oxalic acid for Epsom salts.&nbsp; Could it be that the
Judge&rsquo;s experience as the son of a provincial doctor, had
shown what class of man was before him?&nbsp; Later,
unexpectedly, we learn that the Judge was a steady member for
fourteen years of the Royal Humane Society, of which institution
he was also a Vice-President.</p>
<p>But we now come to a most extraordinary thing&mdash;the result
of the young author&rsquo;s telling and most sarcastic portrait
of the irascible little judge.&nbsp; It is curious that Forster,
while enumerating various instances of Boz&rsquo;s severe
treatment of living persons, as a sort of chastisement for their
defects of manner or character, seems not to have thought of this
treatment of the judge&mdash;and passes it by.&nbsp; Nor did he
notice the prompt result that followed on the sketch.&nbsp; The
report of the trial appeared in the March number, 1837&mdash;and
we are told, the luckless judge retired from the Bench, shortly
after the end of Hilary Term, that is in April or the beginning
of May.&nbsp; We may assume that the poor gentleman could not
endure the jests of his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> or the scarcely
concealed tittering of the Barristers, all of whom had of course
devoured and enjoyed the number.&nbsp; <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>We may say
that the learned Sergeant Buzfuz was not likely to be affected in
any way by <i>his</i> picture; it may indeed have added to his
reputation.&nbsp; I confess to some sympathy for the poor old
judge who was thus driven from the Bench.&nbsp; Sam Foote was
much given to this sort of personal attack, and made the lives of
some of his victims wretched.&nbsp; Boz, however, seems to have
felt himself called upon to act thus as public executioner on two
occasions only.&nbsp; After the fall of the judge in June, 1837,
he wanted a model for a tyrannical magistrate in <i>Oliver
Twist</i>&mdash;and Mr. Laing, the Hatton Garden
Magistrate&mdash;a harsh, ferocious personage, at once occurred
to him.&nbsp; He wrote accordingly to one of his friends that he
wished to be <i>smuggled</i> into his office some morning to
study him.&nbsp; This &ldquo;smuggling&rdquo; of course meant the
placing him where he would not be observed&mdash;as a magistrate
knowing his &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; might recognise him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know the man perfectly well&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; So he
did, for he forgot that he had introduced him already in
<i>Pickwick</i> as Nupkins&mdash;whose talk is exactly alike, in
places almost word for word to that of &ldquo;Mr.
Fang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These palliations, Boz, a young fellow of three and twenty or
so, did not pause to weigh.&nbsp; He only saw a testy, red-faced
old fellow with goggle eyes, and seventy-four years old, and past
his work.&nbsp; His infirmities already made him incapable of
carrying through the business of the Court as the mistake,
&ldquo;Is it Daniel Nathaniel or Nathaniel Daniel?&rdquo;
shows.&nbsp; It is curious, however, that this weakness of
misapprehending names is described of another judge,
Arabin&mdash;a strange grotesque.&nbsp; Theodore Hook gives an
amusing specimen in his Gilbert Gurney.</p>
<p>From the general description in the text, it is evident
Stareleigh was the prey of gouty affections&mdash;which swelled
him into grotesque shape, and he found himself <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>unequal to
the office.&nbsp; He died two years after his retirement at No.
13, Montagu Place, Russell Square; so that the Judge in Bardell
<i>v.</i> Pickwick was living close to Perker the Attorney in the
same case.&nbsp; Here we seem to mix up the fictional and the
living characters, but this is the law of
<i>Pickwick</i>&mdash;the confines between the two worlds being
quite confused or broken down.&nbsp; The late commander of our
forces in China, Sir A. Gaselee, is of this family.&nbsp; It
should be remembered, however, when we think of this
judge&rsquo;s frowardness, that judges in those times were
dictatorial and carried matters with a high hand.&nbsp; There
were often angry conflicts between them, and members of the Bar,
and Stareleigh was really not so very tyrannical.&nbsp; He did
what so many judges do&mdash;took a side from the first, and had
decided in his own mind that Mr. Pickwick could not possibly have
a case.&nbsp; That curious form of address from the Bench is now
no longer heard&mdash;&ldquo;who is with you, <i>Brother
Buzfuz</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Judges and sergeants were then common
members of the Guild&mdash;both wore the &ldquo;coif.&rdquo;</p>

37</span>THE COURT.</h2>
<p>When the swearing of the jury is going on, how good, and how
natural is the scene with the unfortunate chemist.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Answer to your names, gentlemen that you
may be sworn,&rsquo; said the gentleman in black.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Richard Upwitch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the greengrocer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thomas Groffin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the chemist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the book, gentlemen.&nbsp; You shall well and
truly try&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg this court&rsquo;s pardon,&rsquo; said the
chemist, who was a tall, thin, yellow-visaged man, &lsquo;but I
hope this court will excuse my attendance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On what grounds, sir?&rsquo; replied Mr. Justice
Stareleigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no assistant, my Lord,&rsquo; said the
chemist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help that, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr.
Justice Stareleigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;You should hire one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it, my Lord,&rsquo; rejoined the
chemist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you ought to be able to afford it, sir,&rsquo;
said the judge, reddening; for Mr. Justice Stareleigh&rsquo;s
temper bordered on the irritable, and brooked not
contradiction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I <i>ought</i> to do, if I got on as well as I
deserved, but I don&rsquo;t, my Lord,&rsquo; answered the
chemist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swear the gentleman,&rsquo; said the judge,
peremptorily.</p>
<p>The officer had got no farther than the &lsquo;You shall <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>well and truly try,&rsquo; when he was again interrupted
by the chemist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am to be sworn, my Lord, am I?&rsquo; said the
chemist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, sir,&rsquo; replied the testy little
judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, my Lord,&rsquo; replied the chemist in a
resigned manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be murder before
this trial&rsquo;s over; that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Swear me, if you
please, sir;&rsquo; and sworn the chemist was, before the judge
could find words to utter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I merely wanted to observe, my Lord,&rsquo; said the
chemist, taking his seat with great deliberation, &lsquo;that
I&rsquo;ve left nobody but an errand boy in my shop.&nbsp; He is
a very nice boy, my Lord, but he is not acquainted with drugs;
and I know that the prevailing impression on his mind is, that
Epsom salts means oxalic acid; and syrup of senna,
laudanum.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all, my Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; With
this, the tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable
attitude, and, assuming a pleasant expression of countenance,
appeared to have prepared himself for the worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One who was born in the same year as Boz, but who was to live
for thirty years after him, Henry Russell&mdash;composer and
singer of &ldquo;The Ivy Green&rdquo;&mdash;was, when a youth,
apprenticed to a chemist, and when about ten years old, that is
five years before Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick, was left in charge
of the shop.&nbsp; He discovered just in time that he had served
a customer who had asked for Epsom salts with poison sufficient
to kill fifty people.&nbsp; On this he gave up the
profession.&nbsp; I have little doubt that he told this story to
his friend a dozen years later, and that it was on Boz&rsquo;s
mind when he wrote.&nbsp; Epsom salts was the drug mentioned in
both instances.</p>
<p>It must be said that even in our day a defendant for Breach,
with Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s story and surroundings, would have had
small chance with a city jury.&nbsp; They <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>saw before
them a benevolent-looking Lothario, of a Quaker-like air, while
all the witnesses against him were his three most intimate
friends and his own man.</p>
<p>We have, of course, testy judges now, who may be
&ldquo;short&rdquo; in manner, but I think it can be affirmed
that no judge of our day could behave to counsel or witnesses as
Mr. Justice Stareleigh did.&nbsp; It is, in fact, now the tone
for a judge to affect a sort of polished courtesy, and to impart
a sort of light gaiety to the business he is transacting.&nbsp;
All asperity and tyrannous rudeness is held to be out of
place.&nbsp; Hectoring and bullying of witnesses will not be
tolerated.&nbsp; The last exhibition was perhaps that of the late
Dr. Kenealy in the Tichborne case.</p>
<p>All the swearing of jurymen before the court, with the
intervention of the judge, has been got rid of.&nbsp; The Master
of the Court, or Chief Clerk, has a number of interviews&mdash;at
his public desk&mdash;with important individuals, bringing him
signed papers.&nbsp; These are excuses of some sort&mdash;medical
certificates, etc.&mdash;with a view to be &ldquo;let off&rdquo;
serving.&nbsp; Some&mdash;most, perhaps&mdash;are accepted, some
refused.&nbsp; A man of wealth and importance can have little
difficulty.&nbsp; Of course this would be denied by the jurists:
but, somehow, the great guns contrive not to attend.&nbsp; At ten
o&rsquo;clock this officer proceeds to swear the jury, which is
happily accomplished by the time the judge enters.</p>
<h2><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>SERJEANT BUZFUZ.</h2>
<p>Mr. Pickwick, considering the critical nature of his case, was
certainly unfortunate in his solicitor, as well as in the Counsel
selected by his solicitors.&nbsp; The other side were
particularly favoured in this matter.&nbsp; They had a pushful
bustling &ldquo;wide-awake&rdquo; firm of solicitors, who let not
a point escape.&nbsp; Sergeant Buzfuz was exactly the sort of
advocate for the case&mdash;masterful, unscrupulous, eloquent,
and with a singularly ingenious faculty for putting everything on
his client&rsquo;s side in the best light, and his
adversary&rsquo;s in the worst.&nbsp; He could &ldquo;tear a
witness to pieces,&rdquo; and turn him inside out.&nbsp; His
junior, Skimpin, was glib, ready-armed at all points, and
singularly adroit in &ldquo;making a hare&rdquo; of any witness
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>who fell into his hands, <i>teste</i> Winkle.&nbsp; He
had all the professional devices for dealing with a
witness&rsquo;s answers, and twisting them to his purpose, at his
fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; He was the Wontner or Ballantyne of
his day.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s &ldquo;bar&rdquo; was quite
outmatched.&nbsp; They were rather a feeble lot, too respectable
altogether, and really not familiar with this line of
business.&nbsp; Even the judge was against them from the very
start, so Mr. Pickwick had very poor chances indeed.&nbsp; All
this was due to that old-fashioned and rather incapable
&ldquo;Family Solicitor&rdquo; Perker.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p40b.jpg">
<img alt="Serjeant Buzfuz, K.C." src="images/p40s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Serjeant Buzfuz is known the world all over, at least wherever
English is known.&nbsp; I myself was once startled in a
fashionable West End church to hear a preacher, when emphasizing
the value and necessity of Prayer, and the certainty with which
it is responded to, use this illustration: &ldquo;As Serjeant
Buzfuz said to Sam Weller, &lsquo;<i>There is little to do and
plenty to get</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Needless to say, an amused
smile, if not a titter, passed round the congregation.&nbsp; But
it is the Barrister who most appreciates the learned
Serjeant.&nbsp; For the topics he argued and his fashion of
arguing them, bating a not excessive exaggeration, comes home to
them all.&nbsp; Nay, they must have a secret admiration, and
fondly think how excellently well such and such topics are put,
and how they must have told with a jury.</p>
<p>Buzfuz, it is now well known, was drawn from a leading
serjeant of his day, Serjeant Bompas, K.C.&nbsp; Not so long
since I was sitting by Bompas&rsquo;s son, the present Judge
Bompas, at dinner, and a most agreeable causeur he was.&nbsp; Not
only did Boz sketch the style and fashion of the serjeant, but it
is clear that Phiz drew the figure and features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the youngest son of Serjeant Bompas,&rdquo; Judge
Bompas writes to me, &ldquo;and have never heard it doubted that
the name Buzfuz was taken from my father who <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>was at that
time considered a most successful advocate.&nbsp; I think he may
have been chosen for the successful advocate because he was so
successful: but I have never been able to ascertain that there
was any other special resemblance.&nbsp; I do not remember my
father myself: he died when I was eight years old.&nbsp; But I am
told I am like him in face.&nbsp; He was tall (five feet ten
inches) and a large man, very popular, and very excitable in his
cases, so that I am told that Counsel against him used to urge
him, out of friendship, not to get so agitated.&nbsp; A
connection of mine who knew him well, went over to hear Charles
Dickens read the Trial Scene, to see if he at all imitated him in
voice or manner, but told me that he did not do so at all.&nbsp;
I think, therefore, that having chosen his name, as a writer
might now that of Sir Charles Russell, he then drew a general
type of barrister, as he thought it might be satirised.&nbsp; My
father, like myself, was on the Western Circuit and leader of it
at the time of his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a curious episode happen to me once.&nbsp; A
client wrote to apply to the court to excuse a juror on the
ground that he was a chemist and had no assistant who understood
the drugs.&nbsp; It was not till I made the application and the
Court began to laugh that I remembered the Pickwick Trial.&nbsp;
I believe the application was quite bon&acirc; fide, and not at
all an imitation of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; An interesting communication
from one who might be styled &ldquo;Buzfuz&rsquo;s son;&rdquo;
and, as Judge Bompas alludes to his own likeness to his sire, I
may add that the likeness to the portrait in the court scene, is
very striking indeed.&nbsp; There is the same fullness of face,
the large features.&nbsp; Buzfuz was certainly a counsel of power
and ability, and I think lawyers will admit he managed Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s case with much adroitness.&nbsp; His speech,
besides being a sort of satirical abstract of the unamiable
thundering boisterousness addressed to juries <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>in such
cases, is one of much ability.&nbsp; He makes the most of every
topic that he thought likely to &ldquo;tell&rdquo; on a city
jury.&nbsp; We laugh heartily at his would-be solemn and pathetic
passages, but these are little exaggerated.&nbsp; Buzfuz&rsquo;s
statement is meant to show how counsel, quite legitimately, can
bring quite innocent acts to the support of their case by
marshalling them in suspicious order, and suggesting that they
had a connection with the charge made.&nbsp; Many a client thus
becomes as bewildered as Mr. Pickwick was, on seeing his own
harmless proceedings assuming quite a guilty complexion.</p>
<p>Serjeant Buzfuz-Bompas died at the age of fifty-three, at his
house in Park Road, Regents Park, on February 29th, 1844.&nbsp;
He was then, comparatively, a young man, and must have had
ability to have attained his position so early.&nbsp; He was
called to the Bar in 1815, and began as Serjeant in 1827, in
Trinity Term, only a year or so before the famous case was
tried.</p>
<p>So dramatic is the whole &ldquo;Trial&rdquo; in its action and
characters, that it is almost fit for the stage as it
stands.&nbsp; There have been a great number of versions, one by
the author&rsquo;s son, Charles &ldquo;the Younger,&rdquo; one by
Mr. Hollingshead, and so on.&nbsp; It is a favorite piece for
charitable benefits, and a number of well-known performers often
volunteer to figure as &ldquo;Gentlemen of the Jury.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Buzfuz has been often played by Mr. Toole, but his too farcical
methods scarcely enhanced the part.&nbsp; The easiness of comedy
is essential.&nbsp; That sound player Mr. James Fernander is the
best Buzfuz that I have seen.</p>
<p>There is a French translation of <i>Pickwick</i>, in which the
general spirit of the &ldquo;Trial&rdquo; is happily
conveyed.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Phunky&rsquo;s name is given as
&ldquo;M. Finge,&rdquo; which the little judge mistakes for
&ldquo;M. Singe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Buzfuz&rsquo;s speech too is
excellent, especially his denouncing the Defendant&rsquo;s coming
with his chops &ldquo;<i>et son ignoble bassinoire</i>&rdquo;
i.e., warming pan.</p>
<h2><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>THE OPENING SPEECH.</h2>
<p>Buzfuz&rsquo;s great speech is one of the happiest parodies in
the language.&nbsp; Never was the forensic jargon and treatment
so humorously set forth&mdash;and this because of the perfect
<i>sincerity</i> and earnestness with which it was done.&nbsp;
There is none of the far-fetched, impossible
exaggeration&mdash;the form of burlesque which Theodore Hook or
Albert Smith might have attempted.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a real
speech, which might have been delivered to a dull-headed audience
without much impairing credibility.&nbsp; Apart from this it is a
most effective harangue and most plausible statement of the
Plaintiff&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>A little professional touch, which is highly significant as
part of the pantomine, and which Boz made very effective at the
reading, was the Serjeant&rsquo;s dramatic preparation for his
speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having whispered to Dodson and conferred
briefly with Fogg, <i>he pulled his gown over his shoulders</i>,
<i>settled his wig</i>, and addressed the Jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who
has not seen this bit of business?</p>
<p>Again, Juries may have noted that the Junior as he rises to
speak, mumbles something that is quite inaudible, and which
nobody attends to.&nbsp; This is known as &ldquo;opening the
pleadings.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>The ushers again called silence, and Mr. Skimpin
proceeded to &lsquo;open the case;&rsquo; and the case appeared
to have very little inside it when he had opened it, for he kept
such particulars as he knew, completely to himself, and sat down,
after a lapse of three minutes, leaving the jury in precisely the
same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before.</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Serjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and
dignity which the grave nature of the proceedings demanded, and
having whispered to Dodson, and conferred briefly with Fogg,
pulled his gown over his shoulders, settled his wig, and
addressed the jury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A most delightful legal platitude, as one might call it, is to
be found in the opening of the learned Sergeant&rsquo;s
speech.&nbsp; It is a familiar, transparent thing, often used to
impose on the Jury.&nbsp; As Boz says of another topic,
&ldquo;Counsel often begins in this way because it makes the jury
think what sharp fellows they must be.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued
the Serjeant, well knowing that from the learned friend alluded
to they had heard just nothing at all, &ldquo;you have heard from
my learned friend, that this is an action for Breach of Promise
of Marriage, in which the damages are laid at &pound;1,500.&nbsp;
But you have <i>not heard from my learned friend</i>, <i>inasmuch
as it did not lie within my learned friend&rsquo;s province to
tell you</i>, what are the facts and circumstances of the
case.&rdquo;&nbsp; This rich bit of circumlocution is simple
nonsense, in rotund phrase, and meant to suggest the imposing
majesty of legal process.&nbsp; The Jury knew perfectly
beforehand what they were going to try: but were to be impressed
by the magnifying agency of legal processes, and would be awe
stricken accordingly.&nbsp; The passage, &ldquo;inasmuch as it
did not lie within my learned friend&rsquo;s province to tell
you,&rdquo; is a delightful bit of cant.&nbsp; In short, the Jury
was thus admitted to the secret legal arena, and into community
with the learned friends themselves, and were persuaded that they
were very sharp fellows indeed.&nbsp; What pleasant satire is
here, on the mellifluous &ldquo;openings&rdquo; of Counsel, the
putting a romantic gloss on the most prosaic incidents.</p>
<p>A sucking Barrister might well study this speech of Buzfuz as
a guide to the conducting of a case, and above <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>all of rather
a &ldquo;shaky&rdquo; one.&nbsp; Not less excellent is his smooth
and plausible account of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s setting up in
lodging letting.&nbsp; He really makes it
&ldquo;interesting.&rdquo;&nbsp; One thinks of some fluttering,
helpless young widow, setting out in the battle of life.</p>
<p>He describes the poor innocent lady putting a bill in her
window, &ldquo;and let me entreat the attention of the Jury to
the wording of this document&mdash;&lsquo;Apartments furnished
for a single gentleman!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s
opinions of the opposite sex, gentlemen, were derived from a long
contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost
husband.&nbsp; She had no fear&mdash;she had no
distrust&mdash;she had no suspicion&mdash;all was confidence and
reliance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Bardell,&rsquo; said the widow:
&lsquo;Mr. Bardell was a man of honour&mdash;Mr. Bardell was a
man of his word&mdash;Mr. Bardell was no deceiver&mdash;Mr.
Bardell was once a single gentleman himself; to single gentlemen
I look for protection, for assistance, for comfort, and for
consolation&mdash;in single gentlemen I shall perpetually see
something to remind me of what Mr. Bardell was, when he first won
my young and untried affections; to a single gentleman, then,
shall my lodgings be let.&rsquo;&nbsp; Actuated by this beautiful
and touching impulse (among the best impulses of our imperfect
nature, gentlemen), the lonely and desolate widow dried her
tears, furnished her first floor, caught her innocent boy to her
maternal bosom, and put the bill up in her parlour window.&nbsp;
Did it remain there long?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The serpent was on the
watch, the train was laid, the mine was preparing, the sapper and
miner was at work.&nbsp; Before the bill had been in the parlour
window three days&mdash;three days, gentlemen&mdash;a being,
erect upon two legs, and bearing all the outward semblance of a
man, and not of a monster, knocked at the door of Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He enquired within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who attended the Reading will recall the admirable <!--
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>briskness, and more admirable spirit with which Boz
delivered the passage &ldquo;by the evidence of the unimpeachable
female whom I shall place in that&rdquo;&mdash;here he brought
down his palm with a mighty slap on the desk, and added, after a
moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;<i>Box</i> before you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was that <i>preceding</i> of the stroke that told.&nbsp; So
real was it, one fancied oneself listening to some obstreperous
counsel.&nbsp; In all true acting&mdash;notably on the French
boards&mdash;the gesture should a little precede the
utterance.&nbsp; So the serjeant knew something of art.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pickwick gave an indignant start on hearing himself
described as a heartless villain how cleverly does the capable
Buzfuz turn the incident to profit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p47b.jpg">
<img alt="Mr. Pickwick as a Monster" src="images/p47s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I say systematic villany, gentlemen,&rsquo;
said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking through Mr. Pickwick, and talking
<i>at</i> him; &lsquo;and when I say systematic villiany, let me
tell the defendant, Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am informed
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>he is, that it would have been more decent in him, more
becoming, in better judgment and in better taste, if he had
stopped away.&nbsp; Let me tell him, gentlemen, that any gestures
of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge in this
court will not go down with you; that you will know how to value,
and to appreciate them; and let me tell him further, as my lord
will tell you, gentlemen, that a counsel, in the discharge of his
duty to his client, is neither to be intimidated nor bullied, nor
put down; and that any attempt to do either the one or the other,
or the first or the last, will recoil on the head of the
attempter, be he plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name
Pickwick, or Noakes, or Stoakes, or Stiles, or Brown, or
Thompson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This little divergence from the subject in hand, had of course
the intended effect of turning all eyes to Mr. Pickwick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We relish, too, another &ldquo;common form.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
the Serjeant found that his jest as to &ldquo;greasing the wheels
of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s slow-coach&rdquo; had somewhat missed
fire&mdash;a thing that often unaccountably happens, in the case
of the &ldquo;twelve intelligent men,&rdquo; the Serjeant knew
how to adroitly recover himself.</p>
<blockquote><p>He paused in this place to see whether the jury
smiled at his joke; but as nobody took it but the greengrocer,
whose sensitiveness on the subject was very probably occasioned
by his having subjected a chaise-cart to the process in question
on that identical morning, the learned Serjeant considered it
advisable to undergo a slight relapse into the dismals before he
concluded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But enough of this, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Serjeant
Buzfuz, &lsquo;it is difficult to smile with an aching heart; it
is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened.&nbsp; My
client&rsquo;s hopes and prospects are ruined, and it is no
figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>indeed.&nbsp; The bill is down&mdash;but there is no
tenant.&nbsp; Eligible single gentlemen pass and repass&mdash;but
there is no invitation for them to enquire within or
without.&nbsp; All is gloom and silence in the house; even the
voice of the child is hushed; his infant sports are disregarded
when his mother weeps; his &ldquo;alley tors&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;commoneys&rdquo; are alike neglected; he forgets the long
familiar cry of &ldquo;knuckle down,&rdquo; and at tip-cheese, or
odd and even, his hand is out.&nbsp; But Pickwick, gentlemen,
Pickwick, the ruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the
desert of Goswell Street&mdash;Pickwick, who has choked up the
well, and thrown ashes on the sward&mdash;Pickwick, who comes
before you to-day with his heartless tomato sauce and
warming-pans&mdash;Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing
effrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has
made.&nbsp; Damages, gentlemen&mdash;heavy damages is the only
punishment with which you can visit him.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

50</span>THE INCRIMINATING LETTERS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I shall prove to you, gentlemen, that <i>about a year
ago Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home</i>,
during long intervals, (&lsquo;on Pickwick Tours,&rsquo;) <i>as
if with the intention of breaking off from my client</i>: but I
shall show you also that his resolutions were not at that time
sufficiently strong, or that his better feelings conquered, <i>if
better feelings he has</i>: or that the charms and
accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly
intentions.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may note the reserve which suggested
a struggle going on in Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; And how persuasive is
Buzfuz&rsquo;s <i>exegesis</i>!&nbsp; Then, on the letters:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These letters bespeak the character of the man.&nbsp;
They are not open, fervid, eloquent epistles breathing nothing
but the language of affectionate attachment.&nbsp; They are
<i>covert</i>, <i>sly</i>, under-hand communications, but,
fortunately, far more conclusive than if couched in the most
glowing language.&nbsp; <i>Letters that must be viewed with a
cautious and supicious eye</i>: <i>letters that were evidently
intended at the time</i>, <i>by Pickwick</i>, <i>to mislead and
delude any third parties into whose hands they might
fall</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gravity and persuasiveness of all this
is really <i>impayable</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me read the first:
&lsquo;Garraway&rsquo;s, twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Dear Mrs.
B., Chops and tomato sauce.&nbsp; Yours, Pickwick.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Gentlemen, what does this mean?&nbsp; Chops and tomato
sauce.&nbsp; Yours, Pickwick.&nbsp; Chops!&nbsp; Gracious
Heavens!&mdash;and tomato sauce!&nbsp; Gentlemen, is the
happiness of a sensitive and confiding female <i>to be
trifled</i> away by such artifices as these?&nbsp; <i>The next
has no date</i> <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span><i>whatever which is in itself
suspicious</i>: &lsquo;Dear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home until
to-morrow.&nbsp; Slow coach.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then follows the
very remarkable expression, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself
about the warming pan.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a little bit of serious history connected with these
letters which I was the first I think to discover.&nbsp; They
were intended to satirise the trivial scraps brought forward in
Mrs. Norton&rsquo;s matrimonial case&mdash;Norton <i>v.</i> Lord
Melbourne.&nbsp; My late friend, &ldquo;Charles Dickens the
younger,&rdquo; as he used to call himself, in his notes on
<i>Pickwick</i>, puts aside this theory altogether as a mere
unfounded fancy; but it will be seen there cannot be a doubt in
the matter.&nbsp; Sir W. Follett laid just as much stress on
these scraps as Serjeant Buzfuz did on his: he even used the
phrase, &ldquo;it seems there may be latent love like latent
heat, in these productions.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have also,
&ldquo;Yours Melbourne,&rdquo; like &ldquo;Yours Pickwick,&rdquo;
the latter signing as though he were a Peer.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is another of these notes,&rdquo; went on Sir William, &ldquo;How
are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Again there is no beginning you
see.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The next has no date, which is in itself
suspicious,&rdquo; Buzfuz would have added.&nbsp; Another
ran&mdash;&ldquo;I will call about half past four,
Yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>These</i> are the only notes that
have been found,&rdquo; added the counsel, with due gravity,
&ldquo;<i>they seem to import much more than mere words
convey</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this can there be a doubt?</p>
<p>This case was tried in June, 1836, and, it must be borne in
mind, caused a prodigious sensation all over the Kingdom.&nbsp;
The Pickwick part, containing the description, appeared about
December, six months afterwards.&nbsp; Only old people may recall
Norton <i>v.</i> Melbourne, the fair Caroline&rsquo;s wrongs have
long been forgotten; but it is curious that the memory of it
should have been kept alive in some sort by this farcical
parody.&nbsp; Equally curious is it that the public should always
have insisted that she was the heroine of yet another story,
George <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Meredith&rsquo;s <i>Diana</i>, though
the author has disclaimed it over and over again.</p>
<p>The Serjeant&rsquo;s dealing with the warming pan topic is a
truly admirable satiric touch, and not one bit far-fetched or
exaggerated.&nbsp; Any one familiar with suspicious actions has
again and again heard comments as plausible and as forced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about the warming pan!&nbsp;
The warming pan!&nbsp; Why, gentlemen, who <i>does</i> trouble
himself about a warming pen?&rdquo;&nbsp; A delicious <i>non
sequitur</i>, sheer nonsense, and yet with an air of conviction
that is irresistable.&nbsp; &ldquo;When was the peace of mind of
man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming pan which is in
itself a harmless, a useful <i>and I will add</i>,
<i>gentlemen</i>, a comforting article of domestic
furniture?&rdquo;&nbsp; He then goes on ingeniously to suggest
that it may be &ldquo;a cover for hidden fire, a mere substitute
for some endearing word or promise, <i>agreeably to a
preconcerted system</i> of correspondence, artfully contrived by
Pickwick <i>with a view</i> to his contemplated desertion and
which I am not in a position to explain?&rdquo;&nbsp; Admirable
indeed!&nbsp; One could imagine a city jury in their wisdom
thinking that there must be <i>something</i> in this warming
pan!</p>
<p>Not less amusing and plausible is his dealing with the famous
topic of the &ldquo;chops and tomato sauce,&rdquo; not
&ldquo;tomata&rdquo; as Boz has it.&nbsp; I suppose there is no
popular allusion better understood than this.&nbsp; The very man
in the street knows all about it and what it means.&nbsp; Absurd
as it may seem, it is hardly an exaggeration.&nbsp; Counsel every
day give weight to points just as trivial and expound them
elaborately to the jury.&nbsp; The Serjeant&rsquo;s burst of
horror is admirable, &ldquo;Gentlemen, <i>what does this
mean</i>?&nbsp; &lsquo;Chops and tomata sauce!&nbsp; Yours
Pickwick!&rsquo;&nbsp; Chops!&nbsp; Gracious Heavens!&nbsp; What
does this mean?&nbsp; Is the happiness of a sensitive and
confiding female to be trifled away <i>by such shallow artifices
as these</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>I recall that admirable judge and pleasant man, the late
Lord FitzGerald, who was fond of talking of this trial, saying to
me that Buzfuz lost a good point here, as he might have dwelt on
the mystic meaning of tomato which is the &ldquo;love
apple,&rdquo; that here was the &ldquo;secret
correspondence,&rdquo; the real &ldquo;cover for hidden
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He concluded by demanding exemplary damages as &ldquo;the
recompense you can award my client.&nbsp; And for these damages
she now appeals to an enlightened, a high-minded, a right
feeling, a conscientious, a dispassionate, a sympathising, a
contemplative jury of her civilized countrymen!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>THE PLAINTIFF&rsquo;S CASE.</h2>
<p>It was really of a very flimsy kind but
&ldquo;bolstered-up&rdquo; and carried through by the bluster of
the serjeant and the smartness of his junior.&nbsp; It rested
first on a dialogue between Mr. Pickwick and his landlady which
was overheard, in fact by several persons; second, on a striking
situation witnessed by his three friends who entered unexpectedly
and surprised him with Mrs. Bardell in his arms; third, on some
documentary evidence, and lastly, on a damaging incident
disclosed by Winkle.</p>
<p>The first witness &ldquo;put in the box,&rdquo; was Mrs.
Martha Cluppins&mdash;an intimate friend of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>We know that she was sister to Mrs. Raddle, who lived far away
in Southwark, and was the landlady of Mr. Sawyer.&nbsp; She might
have been cross-examined with effect as to her story that she had
been &ldquo;out buying kidney pertaties,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Why
buy these articles in Goswell Street and come all the way from
Southwark?&nbsp; What was she doing there at all?&nbsp; This
question could have been answered only in one way&mdash;which was
that the genial author fancied at the moment she was living near
Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>Besides this, there was another point which Snubbin, in
cross-examination, ought to have driven home.&nbsp; Mrs. Cluppins
was of an inferior type, of the common washerwoman or
&ldquo;charing&rdquo; sort; her language was of Mrs. Gamp&rsquo;s
kind; &ldquo;which her name was&rdquo; so and so.&nbsp; Yet, this
creature, in another room, or on the stairs, the door being
&ldquo;on the jar,&rdquo; can repeat with her limited <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>appreciation, those dubious and imperfect utterances of
Mr. Pickwick!&nbsp; How could she remember all?&nbsp; Or could
she understand them?&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; She, however, may
have caught up something.</p>
<p>Winkle, too, said he heard something as he came up the
stairs&mdash;&ldquo;Compose yourself my dear creature, for
consider if any one were to come,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; But what
could be the value of evidence heard in this way?&nbsp; Would a
jury believe it?&nbsp; &ldquo;Not only,&rdquo; as Sam said,
&ldquo;is &lsquo;wision limited,&rsquo;&rdquo; but hearing
also.</p>
<p>In short, the delicate subtleties of the conversation between
Mr. Pickwick and Mrs. Bardell would be wholly lost in her
hands.&nbsp; Persons of her class know nothing of suggestion or
double meanings or reserved intention, everything for them must
be in black and white.&nbsp; How unlikely, therefore, that
through the panels of a door or through the half opened door,
(&ldquo;she said on the jar,&rdquo;) could she catch the phrases
and their meanings, and, above all, retain them in her
memory?&nbsp; No doubt, as the counsel put it bluntly, she
listened, and with all her ears.</p>
<p>However this may be, here is what Mrs. Cluppins deposed
to:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mrs. Cluppins,&rsquo; said Serjeant Buzfuz,
&lsquo;pray compose yoursel, ma&rsquo;am;&rsquo; and, of course,
directly Mrs. Cluppins was desired to compose herself she sobbed
with increased violence, and gave divers alarming manifestations
of an approaching fainting fit, or, as she afterwards said, of
her feelings being too many for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you recollect, Mrs. Cluppins?&rsquo; said Serjeant
Buzfuz, after a few unimportant questions&mdash;&lsquo;do you
recollect being in Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s back one pair of stairs,
on one particular morning in July last, when she was dusting Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s apartment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my Lord and jury, I do,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
Cluppins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s sitting-room was the first floor
front, I believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&lsquo;Yes it were, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
Cluppins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What were you doing in the back room,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired the little judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Lord and jury,&rsquo; said Mrs. Cluppins, with
interesting agitation, &lsquo;I will not deceive you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better not, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the little
judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was there,&rsquo; resumed Mrs. Cluppins,
&lsquo;unbeknown to Mrs. Bardell; I had been out with a little
basket, gentlemen, to buy three pounds of red kidney pertaties,
which was three pound, tuppense ha&rsquo;penny, when I see Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s street door on the jar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the what?&rsquo; exclaimed the little judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly open, my Lord,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She <i>said</i> on the jar,&rsquo; said the little
judge with a cunning look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same, my lord,&rsquo; said Serjeant
Snubbin.&nbsp; The little judge looked doubtful, and said
he&rsquo;d make a note of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Cluppins then
resumed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I walked in, gentlemen, just to say good mornin&rsquo;,
and went in a permiscuous manner up-stairs, and into the back
room.&nbsp; Gentlemen, there was the sound of voices in the front
room, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you listened, I believe, Mrs. Cluppins,&rsquo; said
Serjeant Buzfuz.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
Cluppins, in a majestic manner, &lsquo;I would scorn the
haction.&nbsp; The voices was very loud, sir, and forced
themselves upon my ear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Cluppins, you were not listening, but you
heard the voices.&nbsp; Was one of those voices Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it were, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Cluppins, after distinctly stating that Mr. Pickwick
addressed himself to Mrs. Bardell, repeated by slow degrees, and
by dint of many questions the conversation with which our readers
are already acquainted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>Now we have to turn back to one of the earlier passages
in the story for the conversation between the pair, &ldquo;with
which the reader is already acquainted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we
shall know what Mrs. Cluppin&rsquo;s might have heard.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Pickwick paced the room to and fro with
hurried steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of
about three minutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and
exhibited many other manifestations of impatience, very unusual
with him.&nbsp; It was evident that something of great importance
was in contemplation, but what that something was not even Mrs.
Bardell herself had been enabled to discover.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bardell,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick at last, as that
amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting
of the apartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your little boy is a very long time gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a good long way to the Borough,
sir,&rsquo; remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Pickwick, &lsquo;very true; so it
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed
her dusting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bardell,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, at the
expiration of a few minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s a much greater expense to keep
two people, than to keep one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;La, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, colouring
up to the very border of her cap, as she fancied she observed a
species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger,
&lsquo;La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but <i>do</i> you?&rsquo; inquired Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That depends&mdash;&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell,
approaching the duster very near to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s elbow,
which was planted on the table; &lsquo;that depends a good deal
upon <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>the person, you know, Mr. Pickwick; and whether
it&rsquo;s a saving and careful person, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
&lsquo;but the person I have in my eye (here he looked very hard
at Mrs. Bardell) I think possesses these qualities; and has,
moreover, a considerable knowledge of the world, and a great deal
of sharpness, Mrs. Bardell; which may be of material use to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;La, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell; the crimson
rising to her cap-border again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as
was his wont in speaking of a subject which interested him,
&lsquo;I do, indeed; and to tell you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I
have made up my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll think it very strange, now,&rsquo; said
the amiable Mr. Pickwick, with a good humoured glance at his
companion, &lsquo;that I never consulted you about this matter,
and never even mentioned it, till I sent your little boy out this
morning, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look.&nbsp; She had long
worshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at
once, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most
extravagant hopes and never dared to aspire.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick
was going to propose&mdash;a deliberate plan, too&mdash;sent her
little boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way&mdash;how
thoughtful&mdash;how considerate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what do you
think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell, trembling
with agitation, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re very kind, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll save you a good deal of trouble,
won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble,
sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bardell; &lsquo;and, of course, I should
take more trouble to please you then, than ever; but it is so
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much consideration
for my loneliness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick; &lsquo;I
never thought of that.&nbsp; When I am in town, you&rsquo;ll
always have somebody to sit with you.&nbsp; To be sure, so you
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I ought to be a very happy woman,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your little boy&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless his heart,&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a
maternal sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He, too, will have a companion,&rsquo; resumed Mr.
Pickwick, &lsquo;a lively one, who&rsquo;ll teach him, I&rsquo;ll
be bound, more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a
year.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you dear&mdash;&rsquo; said Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you kind, good, playful dear,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Bardell; and without more ado, she rose from her chair, and flung
her arms round Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s neck, with a cataract of
tears, and a chorus of sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my soul,&rsquo; cried the astonished Mr.
Pickwick;&mdash;&lsquo;Mrs. Bardell, my good woman&mdash;dear me,
what a situation&mdash;pray&mdash;consider, Mrs. Bardell, if
anybody should come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, let them come,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bardell,
frantically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never leave you, dear, kind, good
soul.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with these words Mrs. Bardell clung the
tighter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every utterance of the little Judge is in character, from his
first directions &ldquo;go on.&rdquo;&nbsp; His suspicious
question, &ldquo;what were you doing in the back room,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;&mdash;and on Serjeant Buzfuz&rsquo;s sudden
pause for breath, when &ldquo;the <i>silence</i> awoke Mr.
Justice Stareleigh, who immediately wrote down something, with a
pen without any ink in it, and looked unusually profound, to
impress his jury with the belief that he always thought most <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>deeply with his eyes shut.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also when at the
&ldquo;on the jar&rdquo; incident&mdash;he &ldquo;looked
doubtful, but said he&rsquo;d make a note of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
when Sam made one of his free and easy speeches, the Judge looked
sternly at Sam for fully two minutes, but Sam&rsquo;s features
were so perfectly calm that he said nothing.&nbsp; When Sam, too,
made his witty <i>reposte</i> to Buzfuz as to his &ldquo;wision
being limited,&rdquo; we are told that there was a great
laugh&mdash;that even &ldquo;the little Judge smiled:&rdquo; a
good touch, for he enjoyed, like other judges, seeing his learned
brother get a fall&mdash;&rsquo;tis human nature.</p>
<p>It must be said the impression of a listener, who had heard
all this could have been anything but favourable to Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; No doubt there was his paternally benevolent
character to correct it: but even this might go against him as it
would suggest a sort of hypocrisy.&nbsp; Even the firmest
friends, in their surprise, do not pause to debate or reason;
they are astonished and wonder exceedingly.</p>

61</span>WINKLE&rsquo;S EVIDENCE.</h2>
<p>Skimpin may have been intended for Wilkin, a later Serjeant
and well-known in the &rsquo;fifties, and whose style and manner
is reproduced.&nbsp; We could not ask a better junior in a
&ldquo;touch and go&rdquo; case.&nbsp; He was as ready to take
advantage of any opening as was the late Lord Bowen, when he was
junior in the Tichborne case.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p61.jpg">
<img alt="Mr. Skimpin" src="images/p61.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On entering the Box, Mr. Winkle &ldquo;bowed to the
Judge,&rdquo; with considerable deference, a politeness quite
thrown away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me sir,&rdquo; said
the Judge sharply, &ldquo;look at the Jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
ungracious, but judges generally don&rsquo;t relish any advances
from witnesses or others.</p>
<p>When poor Winkle was accused by the Judge of giving his name
as Daniel, he was told that &ldquo;he had better be
careful:&rdquo; on which the ready Skimpin: &ldquo;Now, Mr.
Winkle attend to me if you please: and let me <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>recommend
you, for your own sake, to bear in mind his lordship&rsquo;s
injunction to be careful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus by the agency of
Judge and counsel witness was discredited at starting and of
course flurried.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I believe you are a particular friend of
Pickwick, the defendant, are you not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winkle, eager to retrieve himself by being
&ldquo;careful&rdquo; began&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have known Mr. Pickwick now as well as I
recollect at this moment, nearly&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, Mr. Winkle, don&rsquo;t evade the question.&nbsp;
Are you, or are you not a particular friend of the
defendant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was just about to say that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you, or will you not answer my question,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll be committed,
sir,&rsquo; interposed the little Judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Skimpin, &lsquo;<i>yes or
no</i>, <i>if you please</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Yes</i>, <i>you are</i>.&nbsp; <i>And why
couldn&rsquo;t you say that at once</i>, <i>sir</i>?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is no more happy touch of legal satire in the
books than that about &ldquo;What the soldier said.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is perfect, so complete, that it is always understood by
unprofessional readers.&nbsp; The lawyer feels at once that it is
as true as it is happy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Little to do and plenty to get,&rsquo; said
Serjeant Buzfuz to Sam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, quite enough to get, sir, as the soldier said ven
they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You must not tell us what the soldier or any other
man said</i>, <i>sir</i>; <i>it&rsquo;s not evidence</i>,&rsquo;
interposed the Judge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who will forget the roar that always greeted this sally when
Boz read it, or the low and slow solemnity which he imparted to
the Judge&rsquo;s dictum.&nbsp; As an illustration it is simply
admirable.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>Boz himself would have been pleased to find himself
quoted in two impressive legal tomes of some 1800 pages.&nbsp;
The great and laborious John Pitt Taylor could not have been
wholly a legal dry-as-dust: for the man who could have gravely
entered Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick in his notes and have quoted a
passage must have had a share of humour.</p>
<p>Most people know that it is a strict principle that
&ldquo;hearsay evidence&rdquo; of an utterance will not be
accepted in lieu of that of the person to whom the remark was
made.&nbsp; Neither can we think it out of probability that such
an objection may have been made by some over punctilious judge
wishing to restrain Sam&rsquo;s exuberance.&nbsp; A Scotch judge
once quoted in court a passage from <i>The Antiquary</i> in which
he said the true view of an intricate point was given; but then
Scott was a lawyer.</p>
<p>It is requisite, says Mr. John Pitt Taylor (p. 500) speaking
of &ldquo;hearsay evidence&rdquo; that whatever facts a witness
speaks, he should be confined to those lying within his own
knowledge.&nbsp; For every witness should give his testimony on
oath, and should be subject to cross examination.&nbsp; But
testimony from the relation of third persons cannot be subject to
these tests.&nbsp; This rule of exclusion has been recognised as
a fundamental principle of the law of evidence ever since the
time of Charles II.&nbsp; To this he adds a note, with all due
gravity: &ldquo;The rule excluding heresay evidence, or rather
the mode in which that rule is frequently misunderstood in Courts
of Justice, is amusingly caricatured by Mr. Dickens <i>in his
report</i> of the case of Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick, p.
367.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick!&nbsp; He thus puts it with the
many thousand or tens of thousand cases quoted, and he has even
found a place for it in his index of places.&nbsp; He then goes
on to quote the passage, just as he would quote from Barnwall and
Adolphus.</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>How sagacious&mdash;full of legal point&mdash;is
Boz&rsquo;s comment on Winkle&rsquo;s incoherent evidence.&nbsp;
Phunky asked him whether he had any reason to suppose that
Pickwick was about to be married.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh no;
certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle with so much eagerness,
that Mr. Phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all
possible dispatch.&nbsp; Lawyers hold out that there are two
kinds of particularly bad witnesses: a reluctant witness, and a
too willing witness;&rdquo; and most true it is.&nbsp; Both
commit themselves in each case, but in different ways.&nbsp; The
matter of the former, and the manner of the latter do the
mischief.&nbsp; The ideal witness affects indifference, and is as
impartial as the record of a phonograph.&nbsp; It is wonderful
where Boz learned all this.&nbsp; No doubt from his friend
Talfourd, K.C., who carefully revised &ldquo;The
Trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skimpin&rsquo;s interpretation of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
consolatory phrase, which he evidently devised on the spur of the
moment, shows him to be a very ready, smart fellow.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Now, Mr. Winkle, I have only one more
question to ask you, and I beg you to bear in mind his
Lordship&rsquo;s caution.&nbsp; Will you undertake to swear that
Pickwick, the Defendant, did not say on the occasion in
question&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Bardell, you&rsquo;re a good
creature; compose yourself to this situation, for to this
situation you must come,&rdquo; or words to that
effect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t understand him so,
certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, astounded at this ingenious
dove-tailing of the few words he had heard.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was on
the staircase, and couldn&rsquo;t hear distinctly; the impression
on my mind is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions
on your mind, Mr. Winkle, which I fear would be of little service
to honest, straightforward men,&rsquo; interposed Mr.
Skimpin.&nbsp; &lsquo;You were on the staircase, and didn&rsquo;t
distinctly hear; but you will swear that Pickwick <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span><i>did not make use</i> of the expressions I have
quoted?&nbsp; Do I understand that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I will not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle; and down sat
Mr. Skimpin, with a triumphant countenance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;Will you swear he did <i>not</i>,&rdquo; etc., is
a device familiar to cross examiners, and is used when the
witness cannot be got to accept the words or admit that they were
used.&nbsp; It of course means little or nothing: but its effect
on the jury is that they come to fancy that the words <i>may</i>
have been used, and that the witness is not very clear as to his
recollection.</p>
<p>How well described, too, and satirised, is yet another
&ldquo;common form&rdquo; of the cross examiner, to wit the
&ldquo;How often, Sir?&rdquo; question.&nbsp; Winkle, when asked
as to his knowledge of Mrs. Bardell, replied that &ldquo;he did
not know her, but that he had seen her.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I recall
making this very answer to Boz when we were both driving through
Sackville Street, Dublin.&nbsp; He had asked &ldquo;Did I know
so-and-so?&rdquo; when I promptly replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know him, but I have seen him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This rather arrided
him, as Elia would say.)</p>
<p>Skimpin went on:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know her, but you have
seen her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now have the goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury
what you mean by <i>that</i>, Mr. Winkle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean that I am not intimate with her, but that I have
seen her when I went to call on Mr. Pickwick, in Goswell
Street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How often have you seen her, Sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How often?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Yes</i>, <i>Mr. Winkle</i>, <i>how often</i>?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll repeat the question for you a dozen times, if you
require it, Sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the learned gentlemen, with a
firm and steady frown, placed his hands on his hips, and smiled
suspiciously to the jury.</p>
<p><i>On this question there arose the edifying brow-beating</i>,
<i>customary on such points</i>.&nbsp; First of all, Mr. Winkle
said <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>it was quite impossible for him to say how many times he
had seen Mrs. Bardell.&nbsp; Then he was asked if he had seen her
twenty times, to which he replied, &lsquo;Certainly,&mdash;more
than that.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he was asked whether he
hadn&rsquo;t seen her a hundred times&mdash;whether he
couldn&rsquo;t swear that he had seen her more than fifty
times&mdash;whether he didn&rsquo;t know that he had seen her at
least seventy-five times, and so forth; the satisfactory
conclusion which was arrived at, at last, being&mdash;that he had
better take care of himself, and mind what he was about.&nbsp;
The witness having been, by these means, reduced to the requisite
ebb of nervous perplexity, the examination was concluded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How excellent is this.&nbsp; Who has not heard the process
repeated over and over again from the young fledgeling Counsel to
the old &ldquo;hardbitten&rdquo; and experienced K.C.?</p>
<p>A young legal tyro might find profit as well as entertainment
in carefully studying others of Mr. Skimpin&rsquo;s adroit
methods in cross examination.&nbsp; They are in a manner typical
of those in favour with the more experienced members of the
profession, allowing, of course, for a little humorous
exaggeration.&nbsp; He will note also that Boz shows clearly how
effective was the result of the processes.&nbsp; Here are a few
useful recipes.</p>
<p><i>How to make a witness appear as though he wished to
withhold the truth</i>.<i>&nbsp; How to highly discredit a
witness by an opening question</i>.<i>&nbsp; How to insinuate
inaccuracy</i>.<i>&nbsp; How to suggest that the witness is
evading</i>.<i>&nbsp; How to deal with a statement of a
particular number of instances</i>.<i>&nbsp; How to take
advantage of a witness&rsquo; glances</i>.<i>&nbsp; How to
suggest another imputed meaning to a witness&rsquo; statement and
confuse him into accepting it</i>.</p>
<p>Another happy and familiar form is Skimpin&rsquo;s
interrogation of Winkle as to his
&ldquo;friends&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Are they here?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&lsquo;Yes they are,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, <i>looking
very earnestly towards the spot where his friends were
stationed</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As every one attending courts knows, this is an almost
intuitive movement in a witness; he thinks it corroborates him
somehow.</p>
<p>But how good Skimpin and how ready&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pray attend to me, Mr. Winkle, and <i>never mind
your friends</i>,&rsquo; with another expressive look at the
jury; &lsquo;<i>they must tell their stories without any previous
consultation with you</i>, if none has yet taken place,&rsquo;
another expressive look.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now Sir, tell what you
saw,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Come</i>, <i>out with it</i>,
<i>sir</i>, <i>we must</i> have it sooner or
later.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The assumption here that the witness
would keep back what he knew is adroit and very convincing.</p>
<h2><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>A REVELATION.</h2>
<p>But now we come to a very critical passage in Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s case: one that really destroyed any chance that
he had.&nbsp; It really settled the matter with the jury; and the
worst was, the point was brought out through the inefficiency of
his own counsel.</p>
<p>But let us hear the episode, and see how the foolish Phunky
muddled it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Phunky rose for the purpose of getting
something important out of Mr. Winkle in cross-examination.&nbsp;
Whether he did get anything important out of him, will
immediately appear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p68.jpg">
<img alt="Mr. Phunky" src="images/p68.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I believe, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo; said Mr.
Phunky, &lsquo;that Mr. Pickwick is not a young man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle, &lsquo;old enough to
be my father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr.
Pickwick a long time.&nbsp; Had you ever any reason to suppose or
believe that he was about to be married?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&lsquo;Oh no; certainly not;&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle
with so much eagerness, that Mr. Phunky ought to have got him out
of the box with all possible dispatch.&nbsp; Lawyers hold out
that there are two kinds of particularly bad witnesses, a
reluctant witness, and a too willing witness; it was Mr.
Winkle&rsquo;s fate to figure in both characters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will even go further than this, Mr. Winkle,&rsquo;
continued Mr. Phunky, in a most smooth and complacent
manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you ever see any thing in Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s manner and conduct towards the opposite sex to
induce you to believe that he ever contemplated matrimony of late
years, in any case?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no; certainly not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case,
always been that of a man, who having attained a pretty advanced
period of life, content with his own occupations and amusements,
treats them only as a father might his daughters?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the least doubt of it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle,
in the fulness of his heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
is&mdash;yes&mdash;oh yes&mdash;certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have never known anything in his behaviour towards
Mrs. Bardell, or any other female, in the least degree
suspicious?&rsquo; said Mr. Phunky, preparing to sit down, for
Serjeant Snubbin was winking at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;N&mdash;n&mdash;no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Winkle,
&lsquo;except on one trifling occasion, which, I have no doubt,
might be easily explained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, if the unfortunate Mr. Phunky had sat down when Serjeant
Snubbin winked at him, or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped this
irregular cross-examination at the outset (which he knew better
than to do, for observing Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s anxiety, and well
knowing it would in all probability, lead to something
serviceable to him), this unfortunate admission would not have
been elicited.&nbsp; The moment the words fell from Mr.
Winkle&rsquo;s lips, Mr. <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Phunky sat
down, and Serjeant Snubbin rather hastily told him he might leave
the box, which Mr. Winkle prepared to do with great readiness,
when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay, Mr. Winkle&mdash;stay,&rsquo; said Serjeant
Buzfuz, &lsquo;will your lordship have the goodness to ask him,
what this one instance of suspicious behaviour towards females on
the part of this gentlemen, who is old enough to be his father,
was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hear what the learned counsel says, Sir,&rsquo;
observed the Judge, turning to the miserable and agonized Mr.
Winkle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Describe the occasion to which you
refer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle, trembling with
anxiety, &lsquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Winkle had to relate the whole Ipswich adventure of the
doublebedded room and the spinster lady.</p>
<p>It is surprising that Dodson and Fogg did not ferret out all
about Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s adventure at the Great White
Horse.&nbsp; Peter Magnus lived in town and must have heard of
the coming case; these things <i>do</i> somehow leak out, and he
would have gladly volunteered the story, were it only to spite
the man.&nbsp; But further, Dodson and Fogg must have made all
sorts of enquiries into Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s doings.&nbsp; Mrs.
Bardell herself might have heard something.&nbsp; The story was
certainly in the Ipswich papers, for there was the riot in the
street, the appearance before the mayor, the exposure of
&ldquo;Captain FitzMarshall&rdquo;&mdash;a notable business
altogether.&nbsp; What a revelation in open court!&nbsp; Conceive
Miss Witherfield called to depose to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
midnight invasion.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick himself might have been
called and put on the rack, this incident not concerning his
breach of promise.&nbsp; And supposing that the ubiquitous Jingle
had heard of this business and had gone to the solicitor&rsquo;s
office to volunteer evidence, and most useful evidence it would
have been&mdash;to wit that Mr. Pickwick <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>had been
caught in the garden of a young ladies&rsquo; school and had
alarmed the house by his attempts to gain admission in the small
hours!&nbsp; Jingle of course, could not be permitted to testify
to this, but he could put the firm on the track.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s reputation could hardly have survived these two
revelations, and sweeping damages to the full amount would have
been the certain result.</p>
<p>This extraordinary adventure of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s at the
Great White Horse Inn, Ipswich, verifies Dodson&rsquo;s casual
remark to him, that &ldquo;he was either a very designing or a
most unfortunate man,&rdquo; circumstances being so strong
against him.&nbsp; As the story was brought out, in open court,
owing to the joint indiscretion of Phunky and Winkle, it will be
best, in justice to Mr. Pickwick, to give practically his account
of the affair.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of
course,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good.&nbsp; Tell my servant to bring me up some
hot water at half-past eight in the morning, and that I shall not
want him any more to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And bidding Mr. Pickwick good-night, the chambermaid retired,
and left him alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire, and
fell into a train of rambling meditations.&nbsp; First he thought
of his friends, and wondered when they would join him; <i>then
his mind reverted to Mrs. Martha Bardell</i>; and from that lady
it wandered, by a natural process, to the dingy counting-house of
Dodson and Fogg.&nbsp; From Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s it flew off
at tangent, to the very centre of the history of the queer
client; and then it came back to the Great White Horse at
Ipswich, with sufficient clearness to convince Mr. Pickwick that
he was falling asleep: so he aroused himself, and began to
undress, when he <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>recollected he had left his watch on
the table down stairs.&nbsp; So as it was pretty late now, and he
was unwilling to ring his bell at that hour of the night, he
slipped on his coat, of which he had just divested himself, and
taking the japanned candlestick in his hand, walked quietly down
stairs.</p>
<p>The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the more stairs there
seemed to be to descend, and again and again, when Mr. Pickwick
got into some narrow passage, and began to congratulate himself
on having gained the ground-floor, did another flight of stairs
appear before his astonished eyes.&nbsp; At last he reached a
stone hall, which he remembered to have seen when he entered the
house.&nbsp; Passage after passage did he explore; room after
room did he peep into; at length, just as he was on the point of
giving up the search in despair, he opened the door of the
identical room in which he had spent the evening, and beheld his
missing property on the table.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and proceeded to
retrace his steps to his bed-chamber.&nbsp; If his progress
downwards had been attended with difficulties and uncertainty,
his journey back, was infinitely more perplexing.&nbsp; Rows of
doors, garnished with boots of every shape, make, and size,
branched off in every possible direction.&nbsp; A dozen times did
he softly turn the handle of some bedroom door, which resembled
his own, when a gruff cry from within of &ldquo;Who the
devil&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What do want here?&rdquo;
caused him to steal away on tiptoe, with a perfectly marvellous
celerity.&nbsp; He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an
open door attracted his attention.&nbsp; He peeped in&mdash;right
at last.&nbsp; There were the two beds, whose situation he
perfectly remembered, and the fire still burning.&nbsp; His
candle, not a long one when he first received it, had flickered
away in the drafts of air through which he had passed, and sunk
into the socket, just as he had closed the door after <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>him.&nbsp; &lsquo;No matter,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
&lsquo;I can undress myself just as well by the light of the
fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bedsteads stood, one each side of the door; and on the
inner side of each, was a little path, terminating in a
rush-bottomed chair, just wide enough to admit of a
person&rsquo;s getting into, or out of bed, on that side if he or
she thought proper.&nbsp; Having carefully drawn the curtains of
his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the
rush-bottomed chair, and leisurely divested himself of his shoes
and gaiters.&nbsp; He then took off and folded up, his coat,
waistcoat, and neck-cloth, and slowly drawing on his tasseled
night-cap, secured it firmly on his head, by tying beneath his
chin, the strings which he always had attached to that article of
dress.&nbsp; It was at this moment that the absurdity of his
recent bewilderment struck upon his mind; and throwing himself
back in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick laughed to himself
so heartily, that it would have been quite delightful to any man
of well-constituted mind to have watched the smiles which
expanded his amiable features, as they shone forth, from beneath
the night-cap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the best idea,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick to
himself, smiling till he almost cracked the night-cap
strings&mdash;&lsquo;It is the best idea, my losing myself in
this place, and wandering about those staircases, that I ever
heard of.&nbsp; Droll, droll, very droll.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here Mr.
Pickwick smiled again, a broader smile than before, and was about
to continue the process of undressing, in the best possible
humour, when he was suddenly stopped by a most unexpected
interruption; to wit, the entrance into the room of some person
with a candle, who, after locking the door, advanced to the
dressing table, and set down the light upon it.</p>
<p>The smile that played upon Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s features, was
instantaneously lost in a look of the most unbounded and
wonder-stricken surprise.&nbsp; The person, whoever it <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>was,
had come so suddenly and with so little noise, that Mr. Pickwick
had had no time to call out, or oppose their entrance.&nbsp; Who
could it be?&nbsp; A robber?&nbsp; Some evil-minded person who
had seen him come upstairs with a handsome watch in his hand,
perhaps.&nbsp; What was he to do!</p>
<p>The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of
his mysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen
himself, was by creeping on to the bed, and peeping out from
between the curtains on the opposite side.&nbsp; Keeping the
curtains carefully closed with his hand, so that nothing more of
him could be seen than his face and nightcap, and putting on his
spectacles, he mustered up courage, and looked out.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay.&nbsp;
Standing before the dressing glass, was a middle-aged lady in
yellow curl-papers, busily engaged in brushing what ladies call
their &ldquo;back hair.&rdquo;&nbsp; However the unconscious
middle-aged lady came into that room, it was quite clear that she
contemplated remaining there for the night; for she had brought a
rushlight and shade with her, which with praiseworthy precaution
against fire, she had stationed in a basin on the floor, where it
was glimmering away, like a gigantic lighthouse, in a
particularly small piece of water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my soul,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;what
a dreadful thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said the lady; and in went Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s head with automaton-like rapidity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never met with anything so awful as
this,&rsquo;&mdash;thought poor Mr. Pickwick, the cold
perspiration starting in drops upon his nightcap.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never.&nbsp; This is fearful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see
what was going forward.&nbsp; So out went Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
head again.&nbsp; The prospect was worse than <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>before.&nbsp;
The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her hair; had
carefully enveloped it, in a muslin nightcap with a small plaited
border, and was gazing pensively on the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This matter is growing alarming&rsquo;&mdash;reasoned
Mr. Pickwick with himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t allow
things to go on in this way.&nbsp; By the self-possession of that
lady, it&rsquo;s clear to me that I must have come into the wrong
room.&nbsp; <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>If I call out, she&rsquo;ll alarm the
house, but if I remain here, the consequences will be still more
frightful.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p75b.jpg">
<img alt="The Double Bedded Room, Great White Horse, Ipswich"

</a></p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick, it is quite unnecessary to say, was one of the
most modest and delicate-minded of mortals.&nbsp; The very idea
of exhibiting his nightcap to a lady, overpowered him, but he had
tied those confounded strings in a knot, and do what he would, he
couldn&rsquo;t get it off.&nbsp; The disclosure must be
made.&nbsp; There was only one other way of doing it.&nbsp; He
shrunk behind the curtains, and called out very loudly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha&mdash;hum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident, by
her falling up against the rushlight shade; that she persuaded
herself it must have been the effect of imagination was equally
clear, for when Mr. Pickwick, under the impression that she had
fainted away, stone-dead from fright, ventured to peep out again,
she was gazing pensively on the fire as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most extraordinary female this,&rsquo; thought Mr.
Pickwick, popping in again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha&mdash;hum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These last sounds, so like those in which, as legends inform
us, the ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of
expressing his opinion that it was time to lay the cloth, were
too distinctly audible, to be again mistaken for the workings of
fancy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gracious Heaven!&rsquo; said the middle-aged lady,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;only a gentleman,
Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick from behind the
curtains.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A gentleman!&rsquo; said the lady with a terrific
scream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rsquo; thought Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange man,&rsquo; shrieked the lady.&nbsp; Another
instant and the house would be alarmed.&nbsp; Her garments
rustled as she rushed towards the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;&mdash;said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting
out his head, in the extremity of desperation,
&lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Now although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any
definite object in putting out his head, it was instantaneously
productive of a good effect.&nbsp; The lady, as we have alreaded
stated, was near the door.&nbsp; She must pass it, to reach the
staircase, and she would most undoubtedly have done so by this
time, had not the sudden apparition of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
nightcap driven her back, into the remotest corner of the
apartment, where she stood, staring wildly at Mr. Pickwick, while
Mr. Pickwick, in his turn, stared wildly at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wretch,&rsquo;&mdash;said the lady, covering her eyes
with her hands, &lsquo;what do you want here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;nothing whatever,
Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, earnestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing!&rsquo; said the lady, looking up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, Ma&rsquo;am, upon my honour,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, nodding his head so energetically, that the tassel of
his nightcap danced again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am almost ready to
sink, Ma&rsquo;am, beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in
my nightcap (here the lady hastily snatched off her&rsquo;s), but
I can&rsquo;t get it off, Ma&rsquo;am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it
a tremendous tug in proof of the statment).&nbsp; It is evident
to me, Ma&rsquo;am, now, that I have mistaken this bedroom for my
own.&nbsp; I had not been here five minutes, Ma&rsquo;am, when
you suddenly entered it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If this improbable story be really true,
Sir,&rsquo;&mdash;said the lady, sobbing violently, &lsquo;you
will leave it instantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, Ma&rsquo;am, with the greatest pleasure,&rsquo;
replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Instantly, Sir,&rsquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Pickwick
very quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Certainly, Ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I&mdash;am very sorry, Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, making his appearance at the bottom of the bed,
&lsquo;to have been the innocent occasion of this alarm and
emotion; deeply sorry Ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>The lady pointed to the door.&nbsp; One excellent
quality of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s character was beautifully
displayed at this moment, under the most trying
circumstances.&nbsp; Although he had hastily put on his hat over
his night cap, after the manner of the old patrol; although he
carried his shoes and gaiters in his hand, and his coat and
waistcoat over his arm, nothing could subdue his native
politeness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am exceedingly sorry, Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, bowing very low.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are, Sir, you will at once leave the
room,&rsquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Immediately, Ma&rsquo;am; this instant,
Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, opening the door, and
dropping both his shoes with a loud crash in so doing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Pickwick,
gathering up his shoes, and turning round to bow again, &lsquo;I
trust, Ma&rsquo;am, that my unblemished character, and the
devoted respect I entertain for your sex, will plead as some
slight excuse for this&rsquo;&mdash;But before Mr. Pickwick could
conclude the sentence, the lady had thrust him into the passage,
and locked and bolted the door behind him.</p>
<p>Whatever grounds of self-congratulation Mr. Pickwick might
have, for having escaped so quietly from his late awkward
situation, his present position was by no means enviable.&nbsp;
He was alone, in an open passage, in a strange house, in the
middle of the night, half dressed; it was not to be supposed that
he could find his way in perfect darkness to a room which he had
been wholly unable to discover with a light, and if he made the
slightest noise in his fruitless attempts to do so, he stood
every chance of being shot at, and perhaps killed, by some
wakeful traveller.&nbsp; He had no resource but to remain where
he was, until daylight appeared.&nbsp; So after groping his way a
few paces down the passage, and to his infinite alarm, stumbling
over several pairs of boots <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>in so doing,
Mr. Pickwick crouched into a little recess in the wall, to wait
for morning, as philosophically as he might.</p>
<p>He was not destined, however, to undergo this additional trial
of patience: for he had not been long ensconced in his present
concealment when, to his unspeakable horror, a man, bearing a
light, appeared at the end of the passage.&nbsp; His horror was
suddenly converted into joy, however, when he recognized the form
of his faithful attendant.&nbsp; It was indeed Mr. Samuel Weller,
who after sitting up thus late, in conversation with the Boots,
who was sitting up for the mail, was now about to retire to
rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine this story told by Miss Witherfield in open court,
with all its details, the lady&rsquo;s narrative being coloured
by the recollection that she had lost a suitable husband owing to
her adventure.&nbsp; Mr. Peter Magnus would have deposed to Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s extraordinary interest in the matter of the
proposal, and have added his suspicions on recalling Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s ambiguous declaration that he had come down to
expose a certain person&mdash;even one of his own sympathetic
friends, who had witnessed the scene with Mrs. Bardell, and
recalled the Boarding House incident, might murmur, &ldquo;How
odd that he is ever thus in pursuit of the fair under suspicious
circumstances? <i>could</i> it be that after all?&mdash;What if
he had some previous knowledge of the lady, and secretly admired
her, and stung to fury at the notion of Mr. Peter Magnus
marrying, had taken this strange mode of declaring his
passion?&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the sagacious Sam, devoted as he was
to his master, was taken aback on meeting him in his midnight
wanderings.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly
appearing before him, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my bedroom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Weller stared at his master with the most emphatic
surprise; and it was not until the question had <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>been repeated
three several times, that he turned round, and led the way to the
long-sought apartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he got into bed,
&lsquo;I have made one of the most extraordinary mistakes
to-night, that ever were heard of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Werry likely, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller,
drily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But of this I am determined, Sam,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, &lsquo;that if I were to stop in this house for six
months, I would never trust myself about it alone,
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the wery prudentest resolution as you
could come to, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
rayther want somebody to look arter you, Sir, ven your judgment
goes out a wisitin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that, Sam?&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; He raised himself in bed, and extended his hand,
as if he were about to say something more; but suddenly checking
himself, turned round, and bade his valet &lsquo;Good
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night, Sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.&nbsp; He
paused when he got outside the door&mdash;shook his
head&mdash;walked on&mdash;stopped&mdash;snuffed the
candle&mdash;shook his head again&mdash;and finally proceeded
slowly to his chamber, apparently buried in the profoundest
meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen that Sam went near to being disrespectful in
his sceptical view of his master&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Sanders was examined, &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; put a
few questions to her, as to the customs of love-making among
persons of her position.&nbsp; She had &ldquo;received love
letters, like other ladies.&nbsp; In the course of their
correspondence Mr. Sanders had often called her a
&lsquo;duck&rsquo; but never &lsquo;chops&rsquo; or &lsquo;tomato
sauce.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was particularly fond of ducks.&nbsp;
Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce, he
might have called her that, as a term of affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanders was clearly one of the same class as Mrs.
Cluppins, and chiefly deposed to the general impression <!-- page
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>in
the neighbourhood that Mr. Pickwick had &ldquo;offered&rdquo; for
Mrs. Bardell.&nbsp; Tupman, Snodgrass and Sam were also
examined.&nbsp; Being friends of the defendant, they were from
the outset assumed to be &ldquo;hostile&rdquo; and treated
accordingly.&nbsp; It may be doubted, however, whether it is
permissible to treat &ldquo;your own witnesses&rdquo; in this
rough fashion, until at least they have shown some overt signs of
their hostility, either by reserve, or an obvious determination
to let as little as possible be extracted from them.&nbsp; In
such case, it is usual to apply to the court for its sanction to
deal with them by the severity of cross examination.</p>
<p>When Sam entered the witness box, the Serjeant addressed him:
&ldquo;I believe you are in the service of Mr. Pickwick, the
Defendant in this case.&nbsp; <i>Speak up</i>, <i>if you
please</i>, <i>Mr. Weller</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sam had not had time
to say anything, so the admonition might seem superfluous.&nbsp;
But this is a well-known device.&nbsp; Sam had been
&ldquo;briefed&rdquo; to the Serjeant as a rather dangerous
witness&mdash;somewhat too wide awake.&nbsp; It was necessary
therefore to be short and summary with him.&nbsp; He thus
conveyed to the jury that this Sam was one whom he could address
in this curt way, and who by his low, uncertain accents might try
to hide the truth.&nbsp; Sam, however, disconcerted the plan by
his prompt, ready answer, &ldquo;I <i>mean</i> to speak up,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sam, as we know, clearly brought out the Dodson
and Fogg&rsquo;s damaging assurance to Mrs. Bardell, that no
costs should be charged to her personally.</p>
<p>When the Plaintiff&rsquo;s case was closed, things did not
look particularly bright for Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; It had been
shown on the evidence of his own friends that he had been
surprised with his landlady in his arms; (2) That he had been
corresponding with her on most familiar terms&mdash;at least
Serjeant Buzfuz had made it appear so; (3) Language that
<i>almost</i> amounted to a proposal had <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>been
overheard; (4) And finally, it had been revealed that the
Defendant had been &ldquo;caught&rdquo; in a lady&rsquo;s
bedroom, at an Inn, at midnight!&nbsp; To answer which a
&ldquo;strong&rdquo; case was absolutely essential.&nbsp; This,
we grieve to say, was not forthcoming.</p>
<h2><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>THE DEFENDANT&rsquo;S CASE.</h2>
<p>When we listen to the defence set up for Mr. Pickwick we have
to lament that that worthy gentleman was not better served by his
legal advisers.</p>
<p>On the other side the shrewd Dodson and Fogg had done
admirably for their client.&nbsp; They were sharp clever
attornies, having a thundering, overpowering leader, and a smart,
exceedingly smart junior, one of those &ldquo;wide-awake&rdquo;
brisk fellows who really conduct the case, and will &ldquo;take
silk&rdquo; in a few years.&nbsp; This gentleman could
cross-examine in capital style and address the jury in a language
of his own, by glances, shrugs, and remarks addressed to a
witness, but intended for the jury, as they knew perfectly
well.&nbsp; His style, bearing, and speeches form an admirable
epitome of the arts and devices of a smart counsel.&nbsp; There
are &ldquo;common&rdquo; forms and Skimpin had them at his
fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; As we listen, we feel how admirably
directed they were to work on the jury.</p>
<p>Perker&rsquo;s plan of campaign as announced to Mr. Pickwick,
was a poor one enough, and showed how desperate he thought the
case was.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have only one (course) to adopt, my
dear sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;cross-examine the witnesses:
trust to Snubbin&rsquo;s eloquence, throw dust in the eyes of the
judge, and ourselves on the jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brave words, but
nothing of the programme was carried out.&nbsp; The
cross-examination of the witnesses was but tamely
attempted.&nbsp; Snubbin&rsquo;s eloquence was not displayed
beyond mildly praising his client&rsquo;s good character.&nbsp;
As for &ldquo;throwing dust in the eyes of judge,&rdquo; we <!--
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>have seen Mr. Justice Stareleigh was much too wide awake
for that; while the throwing themselves on the jury was
disastrous.&nbsp; There were several other lines of defence which
a more up-to-date solicitor would not have overlooked.&nbsp; A
less scrupulous man would have made searching enquiries into Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s history and character; but his client, perhaps,
would not have sanctioned this course.</p>
<p>Perker is even absurd enough to talk of a <i>casa</i>, as
though it were some Italian word.</p>
<p>A <i>ca sa</i> was short for a writ of <i>Capias ad
Satisfaciendum</i>, which gave a warrant to the officers to seize
the goods.&nbsp; There were various kinds of this machinery, but
what affected Mr. Pickwick was a <i>Capias ad Satisfaciendum</i>,
to enforce attendance at the Court.&nbsp; The <i>ca sa</i> also
came after judgment, giving authority to imprison the defendant
till the claim was satisfied.</p>
<p>The appearance of such great guns as the two Serjeants is
accounted for by a curious rule that Serjeants only were
permitted to lead in cases read in the Court of Common Pleas. <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; This strange monopoly recalls
that other one, in the Court of Arches, where the advocates and
judges used to exchange places and decide on cases in which
perhaps they had been advocates.&nbsp; These illiberal and
unaccountable restrictions have been swept away, with the Courts
themselves.</p>
<p>Very unusual indeed at this time was the appearance of a
lawyer of Serjeant Snubbin&rsquo;s class in court, and there is a
well-known story how, when Charles Butler made his appearance on
a special occasion, all the Bar crowded in to hear him, and he
had, I think, to get a gown for the occasion.</p>
<p>One is sorry to think that there are no Serjeants now, <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>though at the Irish Bar there is one solitary
survivor&mdash;Serjeant Hemphill.&nbsp; Gone too, are their
&ldquo;coifs&rdquo; and other paraphernalia.&nbsp; With the
abolition of the separate courts they were found
superfluous.&nbsp; We like to hear of Serjeant Parry, Serjeant
Ballantine, Serjeants Warren and Talford, all four literary men.
<a name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a></p>
<p>Having made this initial blunder, Perker did not even instruct
a good, smart and ready junior, but chose instead the incapable
Phunky who really brought out that fatal piece of evidence from
Winkle, which &ldquo;did for&rdquo; his case altogether.&nbsp; He
had no business, as Boz tells us.</p>
<p>This junior, we are told, had been just called, that is to
say, he had been only eight years at the Bar.&nbsp; Snubbin had
never heard of him.&nbsp; The little judge, in court, also said
&ldquo;that he never had the pleasure of hearing the
gentleman&rsquo;s name before,&rdquo; a sneer he would not have
ventured on to a counsel in good practice.&nbsp; Snubbin&rsquo;s
remark is amusing and sarcastic; but now-a-days any barrister who
had been at the Bar eight years would not be considered as just
called, for if he has been passed over for that time, he is
likely never to make a figure.&nbsp; The rude and unbecoming
sneers, both of Snubbin and the little Judge, seem amazing in our
present code of legal manners.&nbsp; Everything at that time,
however, was much more &ldquo;in the rough&rdquo; and
coarser.&nbsp; This was his first case; and the poor creature is
thus described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although an infant barrister, he was a full-grown
man.&nbsp; He had a very nervous manner, and a painful hesitation
in his speech; it did not appear to be a natural defect, but
seemed rather the result of timidity, arising from the
consciousness of being &ldquo;kept down&rdquo; by want of means,
or interest, or connection, or impudence, <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>as the case
might be.&nbsp; He was overawed by the Serjeant, and profoundly
courteous to the attorney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not had the pleasure of seeing you before, Mr.
Phunky,&rsquo; said Serjeant Snubbin, with haughty
condescension.</p>
<p>Mr. Phunky bowed.&nbsp; He <i>had</i> had the pleasure of
seeing the Serjeant, and of envying him too, with all a poor
man&rsquo;s envy, for eight years and a quarter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are with me in this case, I understand?&rsquo; said
the Serjeant.</p>
<p>If Mr. Phunky had been a rich man, he would have instantly
sent for his clerk to remind him; if he had been a wise one, he
would have applied his fore-finger to his forehead, and
endeavoured to recollect, whether, in the multiplicity of his
engagements he had undertaken this one, or not; but as he was
neither rich nor wise (in this sense at all events) he turned
red, and bowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you read the papers, Mr. Phunky?&rsquo; inquired
the Serjeant.</p>
<p>Here again, Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten
all about the merits of the case; but as he had read such papers
as had been laid before him in the course of the action, and had
thought of nothing else, waking or sleeping, throughout the two
months during which he had been retained as Mr. Serjeant
Snubbin&rsquo;s junior, he turned a deeper red, and bowed
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Mr. Pickwick,&rsquo; said the Serjeant, waving
his pen in the direction in which that gentleman was
standing.</p>
<p>Mr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick with a reverence which a
first client must ever awaken; and again inclined his head
towards his leader.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will take Mr. Pickwick away,&rsquo; said
the Serjeant, &lsquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;hear anything
Mr. Pickwick <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>may wish to communicate.&nbsp; We
shall have a consultation, of course.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this hint
that he had been interrupted quite long enough, Mr. Serjeant
Snubbin, who had been gradually growing more and more abstracted,
applied his glass to his eyes for an instant, bowed slightly
round, and was once more deeply immersed in the case before him:
which arose out of an interminable law suit, originating in the
act of an individual, deceased a century or so ago, who had
stopped up a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever
came from, to some other place which nobody ever went to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With such a pair the case was literally given away.&nbsp;
Perker should have secured a man like the present Mr. Gill or Mr.
Charles Matthews&mdash;they might have &ldquo;broken down&rdquo;
the witnesses, or laughed the case out of court.</p>
<p>We may speculate&mdash;why did Perker make this foolish
selection?&nbsp; As to Snubbin there was some excuse, as it was
the custom that Serjeants only should lead in the Court of Common
Pleas.&nbsp; But for the choice of Phunky, Perker&rsquo;s
stupidity alone was responsible.</p>
<p>Under these conditions Serjeant Snubbin&rsquo;s conduct of the
case and his &ldquo;handling&rdquo; of the witnesses was truly
inefficient.&nbsp; He lost every opportunity for helping his
client.&nbsp; He &ldquo;led&rdquo; in a quiet, gentlemanly and
almost indifferent way.&nbsp; His first opportunity came in
examining Mrs. Cluppins.&nbsp; As we have seen, she had deposed
to hearing, when the door was &ldquo;on the jar,&rdquo; Mr.
Pickwick make those speeches which Mrs. Bardell had taken to be a
proposal.&nbsp; Now here was the moment to show the ambiguity and
that Mr. Pickwick was speaking of his servant.&nbsp; It might
have been brought out that Sam was actually engaged that day, and
that she had met him on the stairs, etc.&nbsp; But Snubbin
declined to ask her a single question, saying that Mr. Pickwick
admitted <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the accuracy of her statement.&nbsp;
But this was beside the matter, and the Serjeant need not have
impeached her accuracy.</p>
<p>When Phunky came to Winkle, the inexperience of the tyro was
shown at once.&nbsp; Again, here was the moment to have extracted
from the witness a full explanation of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
ambiguous speeches to Mrs. Bardell.&nbsp; He could have
&ldquo;brought out&rdquo; as &ldquo;clear as the light of
day&rdquo; that Mr. Pickwick was speaking of his engagement of a
valet and have shown that the valet was to be engaged that very
morning.&nbsp; It would have been impossible to resist such an
explanation.&nbsp; But the thing was not thought of.&nbsp; From
him also could have been drawn a vast deal favourable to Mr.
Pickwick such as his disgust and annoyance at Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s behaviour, his wish to be rid of her, his
complaints of her conduct.&nbsp; But no, there was only the
foolish question as to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s being an elderly man
and of fatherly ways, a topic that would by no means negative the
presumption of matrimony.&nbsp; But nothing could excuse the
rashness of putting a general question as to &ldquo;Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s behaviour towards females.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
adroit counsel would run the risk of encountering a too
conscientious witness, such as Winkle proved to be and who would
&ldquo;let the cat out of the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we have seen, this awkward question settled Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; Snubbin had held him out as an
elderly but benevolent being, treating every female he met as a
daughter, never dreaming of matrimony: when lo! the whole fabric
is overthrown in an instant by the luckless Winkle&rsquo;s
admission!</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid the profound silence of the whole court Mr.
Winkle faltered out that the trifling circumstance of suspicion
was Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s being found in a lady&rsquo;s sleeping
apartment at midnight, which had terminated, <i>he believed</i>,
in breaking off the projected marriage of the <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>lady, and had
led, <i>he knew</i>, to the whole party being forcibly carried
before a magistrate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus was the defendant suddenly revealed as a Pecksniffian
Lothario, and his pretence of philanthrophy after was shewn in
its true colours.&nbsp; It was impossible not to associate this
with the scene with Mrs. Bardell.</p>
<p>But there was an important legal &ldquo;point&rdquo; which one
might have expected would have occurred to so eminent a Chamber
Counsel as Serjeant Snubbin.&nbsp; To prove a breach of the
promise, it must always be shown that the defendant had been
given an opportunity of officially refusing to fulfil it.&nbsp;
It should have been put to him &ldquo;in black and white,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; and he must have answered
&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; or something to that effect.&nbsp;
In default of this the defendant might plead &ldquo;True I gave
the promise and it stands unbroken, for you never required me to
act upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s case this
actually occurred.&nbsp; As we have seen he left town the morning
after the imputed proposal and while he was away, within a month,
the notice of action was sent to him.&nbsp; Up to that time he
had not heard a word of Dodson and Fogg, or of legal
proceedings.&nbsp; But it may be urged that Mrs. Bardell herself
may have written, formulating her demands.&nbsp; That this was
not the case is evident from Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s behaviour; he
did not dream of such a thing, or he would have been disturbed by
it, or have consulted his friends about it.&nbsp; Had it been so,
his high opinion of Mrs. Bardell would have been shattered.&nbsp;
For did he not say on seeing Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s letter,
&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t do it, she hasn&rsquo;t the heart to do
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only thing that makes against this theory is
his reply to Peter Magnus who asked him &ldquo;had he ever
proposed?&rdquo; when he answered vehemently &ldquo;Never,&rdquo;
possibly recalling Mrs. Bardell.&nbsp; She may however have
written to him a pleading letter reminding him of what he had
said to her, declaring her deep-seated <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>affection for
him and inviting him to carry out what he had offered.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick would have replied in one of his amiable letters,
couched in rather general terms, perhaps calling her &ldquo;my
dear creature,&rdquo; but putting aside the whole business: and
there the matter probably dropped for a time.&nbsp; I have little
doubt the good woman up to the last really believed that her
elderly lodger intended to make her an offer of his hand, and
that on his return from his travels he would resume the
business.&nbsp; Much elated by this prospect, and most naturally
too, she had told all her friends and neighbours of her
approaching advancement.&nbsp; This Mrs. Sanders specially
deposed to: &ldquo;had always said and believed that Pickwick
would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell being engaged to
Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the
neighbourhood, after the fainting in July; had been told it
herself by Mrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle, and Mrs. Bunkin
which clear-starched, but did not see either Mrs. Mudberry or
Mrs. Bunkin in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these speculations, it still does not appear
that Pickwick made such a legal and official refusal to execute
his promise as would be sufficient to support the statement of
what is now called &ldquo;the summons and plaint,&rdquo; to wit,
that the plaintiff being able and willing &ldquo;to marry the
defendant the defendant refused, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another matter on which hands of skilful counsel
might have affected Mrs. Bardell and which my friend Mr. Burnand
(&ldquo;F. C. B.&rdquo;) was the first to push home.&nbsp; At the
trial, Mrs. Saunders cross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin, had to
admit that her friend had an admirer&mdash;a certain Baker in the
neighbourhood&mdash;who was supposed to have matrimonial
designs.&nbsp; Pressed on this matter she thus deposed:
&ldquo;Had heard Pickwick ask the little boy how he should like
to have another <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>father.&nbsp; Did not know that Mrs.
Bardell was at that time keeping company with the baker, but did
know that the baker was then a single man, and is now
married.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t swear that Mrs. Bardell was not
very fond of the baker, but should think that the baker was not
very fond of Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have married
somebody else.&nbsp; Thought Mrs. Bardell fainted away on the
morning in July, because Pickwick asked her to name the day; knew
that she (witness) fainted away stone dead when Mr. Saunders
asked <i>her</i> to name the day, and believed that everybody as
called herself a lady would do the same, under similar
circumstances.&nbsp; Heard Pickwick ask the boy the question
about the marbles, but upon her oath did not know the difference
between an alley tor and a commoney.</p>
<p>By the <span class="smcap">Court</span>.&mdash;During the
period of her keeping company with Mr. Sanders, had received love
letters, like other ladies.&nbsp; In course of their
correspondence Mr. Sanders had often called her a
&lsquo;duck,&rsquo; but never &lsquo;chops,&rsquo; nor yet
&lsquo;tomata sauce.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was particularly fond of
ducks.&nbsp; Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomata
sauce, he might have called her that, as a term of affection.</p>
<p>What a point, too, Serjeant Snubbin missed here!&nbsp; Could
he not have quoted the old verses.&nbsp; How he would have
convulsed the court as he poured out the apropos &ldquo;for Tommy
and Me!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Pat-a-cake, Pat-a-cake, baker&rsquo;s man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bake me a cake as quick as you can;<br />
Knead it and bake it as fast as can be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And put in the oven for Tommy and me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we do not find that the Serjeant made any use of this
topic in his speech.&nbsp; He might have surely urged that this
&ldquo;wily and experienced widow&rdquo; was eager for a husband,
that having been &ldquo;thrown over&rdquo; by her baker and stung
by the mortification, she resolved, as it were, <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>to
rehabilitate herself and prepare this &ldquo;plant&rdquo; for her
unsuspecting lodger.&nbsp; As Sir Henry Irving says in the play,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like widows; <i>they know too
much</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; F. C. B., as I have said, has treated this
baker theme and developed it regularly in his amusing operetta
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little epitome given of Snubbin&rsquo;s speech shows how
weak were his topics, and that he, in fact, considered that there
was no defence.</p>
<blockquote><p>Serjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf
of the defendant; and a very long and a very emphatic address he
delivered, in which he bestowed the highest possible eulogiums on
the conduct and character of Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; He attempted to
show that the letters which had been exhibited, merely related to
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s dinner, or to the preparations for receiving
him in his apartments on his return from some country
excursion.&nbsp; It is sufficient to add in general terms, that
he did the best he could for Mr. Pickwick; and the best, as
everybody knows on the infallible authority of the old adage,
could do no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was no more than speaking &ldquo;in mitigation of
damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Phunky made no speech, which was just as well, as he might
have but damaged the case, as no witnesses had been called on his
side.&nbsp; For the same reason, the Court had not the pleasure
of hearing Skimpin, who would no doubt have &ldquo;torn the
Defendant&rsquo;s case to tatters.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>CHARGE AND VERDICT.</h2>
<p>The regular formula is this.&nbsp; The judge begins to read
his notes, and makes &ldquo;running comments&rdquo; as he goes
along.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have first, gentlemen, the statement of
Mrs. Cluppins, she tells you, &amp;c.&nbsp; Of course she comes
as the friend of the Plaintiff, and naturally takes a favourable
view of her case.&nbsp; If you are satisfied with her statement,
it is for you, gentlemen, to consider what value you will attach
to it.&nbsp; Then we come to the question of damages.&nbsp; This
is entirely a matter for you.&nbsp; You must take into account
the position in life of the Defendant, and what the Plaintiff has
lost by his default.&nbsp; On the other hand they must be
reasonable in amount.&nbsp; If you believe the promise has been
clearly established, you should give substantial though not
excessive damages, on a scale sufficient to repay the Plaintiff
for the wrong.&nbsp; On the other hand&mdash;should it seem to
you doubtful whether the promise had been made&mdash;you will
give the Defendant the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; These are
questions entirely for you&mdash;not for me.&nbsp; On the whole
case, you will ask yourselves, whether a promise such as would
satisfy reasonable men, has been supported by sufficient
evidence.&nbsp; If so, Plaintiff is entitled to damages&mdash;on
the other hand, if this is not proved to your satisfaction, you
will find for the Defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Stareleigh, however, as we are told, then
&ldquo;summed up in his old established and most approved
form.&nbsp; He read as much of his notes as he could decypher on
so short a notice, and made running comments <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>on the
evidence as he went along.&nbsp; If Mrs. Bardell were right, it
was perfectly clear that Mr. Pickwick was wrong, and if they
thought the evidence of Mrs. Cluppins worthy of credence, they
would believe it, and if they didn&rsquo;t, why they
would&rsquo;nt.&nbsp; If they were satisfied that a breach of
promise had been committed, they would find for the Plaintiff,
with such damages as they thought proper; and if, on the other
hand, it appeared to them that no promise of marriage had ever
been given, they would find for the Defendant, with no damages at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was this lucid direction&mdash;which is
really, not in the least, an exaggeration.</p>
<p>But I could fancy some acute judge of our time&mdash;such as
Mr. Justice Day or Mr. Justice Bigham&mdash;after trying this
case, turning round in his seat to &ldquo;charge&rdquo; the
jury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, gentlemen,&rdquo; he would tell them,
&ldquo;we have it claimed on one side that a promise of marriage
was made&mdash;and broken; on the other hand the Defendant denies
having ever given such a promise.&nbsp; The question you will
have to deal with is: What was this promise, and when was it
given?&nbsp; In other words, <i>when</i> did the Defendant
propose to the lady.&nbsp; On the part of the Plaintiff, this was
said to have been done at the interview in Goswell Street, and
two friends of the Plaintiff&mdash;Mrs. Cluppins, I
think&rdquo;&mdash;turning over his notes&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
Cluppins, and Sanders both declare positively that they overheard
the language of the proposal.&nbsp; Further, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
friends are called, to prove that the lady was in his arms,
fainting.&nbsp; It is extraordinary that not one of these three
gentlemen should have deposed to any statements or have offered
explanations of the situation.&nbsp; One witness indeed says that
he heard the Defendant remonstrate with the Plaintiff, on her
hysterical behaviour, and ask her to consider that if any one
should come in, what would be said.&nbsp; Now, this is not the
language of an ardent suitor, who would rather wish than <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>otherwise, that such endearing familiarities should
continue: though I don&rsquo;t think you need seriously accept
the reading the learned Counsel, Mr. Skimpin, put on the phrase
used; on the other hand, the words &lsquo;my dear
creature,&rsquo; were distinctly heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one little incident,&rdquo; the Judge might go
on, &ldquo;which I must not pass by, and which is not without its
significance.&nbsp; A witness deposed that the defendant was
noted for his kindness to the Plaintiff&rsquo;s little
boy&mdash;that he was constantly giving him presents, and once
was heard to say to him, patting him on the head, &lsquo;<i>how
would you like to have another father</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, this
addressed to a child of tender years does seem an odd sort of
speech.&nbsp; Of course, it will be contended that the reference
was to the probability of his Mother marrying some one other than
the Defendant: if that be the case, it seems to me rather an
indelicate and reckless speech.&nbsp; And then it must be said,
it seems inconsistent with the amiable and benevolent character
given to the Defendant to-day.&nbsp; On the other hand, if he
were referring to <i>himself</i> it will appear natural and
proper enough.&nbsp; And there is this to be added, that when the
child had reported the remark to his mother, which of course he
did, she would most reasonably begin to found hopes upon
it.&nbsp; And then what follows, Gentlemen?&mdash;the Defendant
is found holding this lady in his arms, and becomes so
demonstrative in his attentions that this very child comes to her
rescue.&nbsp; I am inexperienced in these things&mdash;they may
be innocent and done with the purest intentions, or may not; but
you, Gentlemen of the Jury, are men of the world: and it is for
you to put the proper construction on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have noted, Gentlemen, this curious feature of
the case.&nbsp; None of the witnesses were in the room when the
imputed proposal was made, yet all, Cluppins, Weller, and the
Defendant&rsquo;s three friends, <i>heard</i> what <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the
Defendant said.&nbsp; This suggests that he must have been very
pressing, if not agitated.&nbsp; One of the witnesses, Winkle, I
think, yes, Winkle, actually deposes to hearing the words,
&lsquo;My dear creature!&nbsp; Compose yourself&rsquo; and the
like.&nbsp; He added he was afraid someone might come in; a very
reasonable fear, Gentlemen, and well grounded: for several
persons <i>did</i> come in and it would seem with awkward results
for the Defendant.&nbsp; But, Gentlemen, I confess that what most
of all weighs with me in this case is the remarkable avowal wrung
from a reluctant witness, of the Defendant&rsquo;s being
surprised at midnight in a lady&rsquo;s bed-chamber, and being
taken, after a serious riot, before the Magistrates.&nbsp; This
came on me, as I saw it did on you all, as a surprise.&nbsp;
True, it does not bear on the question of a promise or of the
breach.&nbsp; But still it seems a matter which you cannot wholly
shut out from your consideration.&nbsp; It startled me as it did
you, to find a sort of travelling philanthropist, as the
Defendant Pickwick holds himself out to be, on whose mildly
benevolent features nature seems to have stamped rectitude and
high principle, living a life of hypocrisy, taking part in
midnight invasions and daylight riots.&nbsp; It is one of his own
friends who tells us this sad story: and it is for you to
consider whether the Plaintiff was here also in pursuit of yet
another disreputable game, holding out marriage as the bait: I
seem to speak strongly, but I feel it would be impossible to
withdraw this from your consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may reasonably ask yourselves of what Pickwick was
afraid&mdash;or why did he dread the presence of witnesses?&nbsp;
Was he simply beguiling the lady, as he attempted to beguile that
lady at Ipswich, without &lsquo;meaning business,&rsquo; as the
phrase runs.&nbsp; I must say the Plaintiff had rather reasonable
grounds for assuming that the Defendant <i>did</i> mean
business.&nbsp; But all this is for you, Gentlemen, not for
me.</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;Then we have the man Weller&rsquo;s
statement&mdash;a sort of humorous stage servant, not
unamusing&mdash;and of course entirely devoted to his
master&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you need
attach any importance to what he said of the solicitors for the
Plaintiff.&nbsp; When I was at the Bar, Gentlemen, attornies did
much worse things than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jury consulted for only a few minutes.&nbsp; Perhaps,
however, they were only discussing the amount of damages.&nbsp;
They were certainly moderate&mdash;laid at
&pound;1500&mdash;though had Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s advice
prevailed, it should have been double.&nbsp; This only, by the
way, is further proof of the amiable Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s
moderation and secret <i>tendre</i> for her genial lodger.&nbsp;
Considering that Mr. Pickwick was &lsquo;a gentleman,&rsquo; and
further a gentleman of means, and that Mrs. Bardell was but an
humble lodging-house keeper, the sum seems hardly
commensurate.&nbsp; Dodson and Fogg no doubt expected
&pound;1,000.</p>
<blockquote><p>An anxious quarter of an hour elapsed; the jury
came back; the judge was fetched in.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick put on
his spectacles, and gazed at the foreman with an agitated
countenance and a quickly beating heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said the individual in black,
&lsquo;are you all agreed upon your verdict?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are,&rsquo; replied the foreman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the
defendant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the plaintiff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With what damages, gentlemen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seven hundred and fifty pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick took off his spectacles, carefully wiped the
glasses, folded them into their case, and put them in his pocket;
then having drawn on his gloves with great nicety, and stared at
the foreman all the while, he mechanically followed Mr. Perker
and the blue bag out of court.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court
fees; and here, Mr. Pickwick was joined by his friends.&nbsp;
Here, too, he encountered Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, rubbing their
hands with every token of outward satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Dodson: for self and
partner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You imagine you&rsquo;ll get your costs, don&rsquo;t
you, gentlemen?&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>Fogg said they thought it rather probable.&nbsp; Dodson
smiled, and said they&rsquo;d try.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may try, and try, and try again, Messrs. Dodson and
Fogg,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick vehemently, &lsquo;but not one
farthing of costs or damages do you ever get from me, if I spend
the rest of my existence in a debtor&rsquo;s prison.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; laughed Dodson.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will
think better of that, before next term, Mr. Pickwick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He, he, he!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll soon see about that Mr.
Pickwick,&rsquo; grinned Mr. Fogg.</p>
<p>Speechless with indignation, Mr. Pickwick allowed himself to
be led by his solicitor and friends to the door, and there
assisted into a hackney-coach, which had been fetched for the
purpose, by the ever watchful Sam Weller.</p>
<p>Sam had put up the steps; and was preparing to jump upon the
box, when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and
looking round, his father stood before him.&nbsp; The old
gentleman&rsquo;s countenance wore a mournful expression, as he
shook his head gravely, and said, in warning accents:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know&rsquo;d what &rsquo;ud come &rsquo;o this here
mode &rsquo;o doin&rsquo; bisness.&nbsp; Oh Sammy, Sammy, vy
worn&rsquo;t there a alleybi!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may wonder that the laborious Chamber Counsel Serjeant
Snubbin did not advise &ldquo;moving for a new
trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; The verdict was clearly a wrong one&mdash;no
sufficient <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>evidence had been furnished either of
a promise, or a breach.&nbsp; The full court would no doubt have
granted the motion, and this would have led to Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s release, for the astute Dodson and Fogg must
have recognised their poor chances, and perhaps have required
&ldquo;security for costs,&rdquo; which their client could not
have given.&nbsp; However, the idea did not occur to anybody.</p>
<p>Since the law was changed both plaintiff and defendant may be
examined in such cases as these.&nbsp; What a different
complexion this would have put on the suit.&nbsp; The whole case
would have tumbled to pieces like a pack of cards.&nbsp; For Mr.
Pickwick &ldquo;put into the box&rdquo; would have clearly shown
that all that had been thus misconstrued, was his proposal for
engaging a valet, which was to have been that very morning.&nbsp;
He would have related the words of the dialogue, and the Jury
would have seen at once how the mistake arose.&nbsp; On the other
hand, he would have been exposed to a severe rating cross
examination by the learned Serjeant&mdash;fortified by
Winkle&rsquo;s most damaging slip about the White Horse
incident&mdash;who would have forced out of him all the
incidents.&nbsp; We can almost hear the Serjeant subject the
Defendant to the torture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow of yours, Sir, was he recommended to you by
a friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a Registry Office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind?&nbsp; I suppose too low a class of
place for you, eh?&nbsp; Come Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor thought it, I suppose?&nbsp; Come, Sir, no beating
about the bush.&nbsp; In plain terms, did you get him from a low
Public House in the Boro&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick started up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;Do you deny it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew that the White Hart was a low
Public-House,&rdquo; said the witness indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what you know, Sir.&nbsp; Did you or did you
not get him from there?&rdquo; thundered the Serjeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you did.&nbsp; Then what&rsquo;s the use of
all this juggling.&nbsp; It does you no good with My Lord and the
Jury.&nbsp; I tell you plainly, Mr. Pickwick, we mean to have all
out of you.&nbsp; Now Sir, was this man of yours an experienced
valet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had, of course, some training in his profession in
other families?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that you know of.&nbsp; Do you dare to persist in
that, Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask <i>me</i> questions, Sir, I&rsquo;m
asking <i>you</i>.&nbsp; Do you deny, Sir, that the man was
neither more nor less than a common Boots in the yard of a Public
House, wearing an old tattered hat and jacket&mdash;very
different from the suit in which you have rigged him up here
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick was astonished and silent.&nbsp; He was
suffering.&nbsp; He had never dreamed of this view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want none of your supposes, Sir, answer yes or
no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well he certainly was such as you describe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flutter ran round the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this creature of yours, you would impose on the
Jury as a trained man servant.&nbsp; You may go down
Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>PLEA FOR &ldquo;DODSON AND
FOGG.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This famous firm of city attornies has become a bye-word in
legal history&mdash;being considered the most notorious of
practitioners for sharp, underhand, scheming practices.&nbsp; Boz
was always vehement against the abuses of the law, but his
generous ardour sometimes led him to exaggerated and wholesale
statements that were scarcely well founded.&nbsp; This is found
in some degree even in the sweeping attacks in <i>Bleak
House</i>.&nbsp; But he was so vivid, so persuasive, in his
pictures, that there was no appeal.</p>
<p>The unreasoning fury of Mr. Pickwick is specially shown in the
case of Jingle, whom he pursued with an animosity that was almost
frantic.&nbsp; One would think it was some public enemy he was
hunting down for the public good.&nbsp; Poor Jingle had really
done nothing so monstrous, after all.&nbsp; He had
&ldquo;chaffed&rdquo; Dr. Slammer, &ldquo;run off&rdquo; with the
spinster aunt&mdash;nothing so uncommon in those days&mdash;had
been consigned to the Fleet for non-payment of his debts, and
there showed penitence and other signs of a good heart.&nbsp; His
one serious offence was passing himself off as a naval officer,
and under an assumed name.&nbsp; But he had <i>crossed</i> Mr.
Pickwick&mdash;had ridiculed him&mdash;had contemptuously sent a
message to &ldquo;Tuppy.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he dared to play a
practical joke on his persecutor, his infamy passed beyond
bounds.&nbsp; Here was the key to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
nature&mdash;any lack of homage or respect was an offence against
morality.&nbsp; So with Dodson and Fogg.&nbsp; He had settled in
his mind <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>that a condescending visit to these
gentlemen, with a little explanation and remonstrance would
completely disarm them.&nbsp; His fury on his advances being
rejected was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Here Boz shows, as he ever does, his profound and most logical
treatment of human character.&nbsp; He never goes astray, being
guided by a happy and true instinct.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick had grown
to be the most inflated of men.&nbsp; Flattered and
followed&mdash;submitted to with the greatest
deference&mdash;ordering people about&mdash;doing what he
pleased&mdash;he could not stand the slightest opposition.&nbsp;
No one was to contradict&mdash;no one to question even his
stockings&mdash;speckled or others.&nbsp; Even when he was
clearly wrong, it was an affront to hint at it.&nbsp; He had much
in common with that great man, Mr. Gladstone, who was the
political Pickwick of his time.&nbsp; He was overbearing and
arrogant and unrestrained, and I am afraid vindictive.&nbsp;
Dodson and Fogg were associated with the great mortification of
his life.&nbsp; He could not forgive them&mdash;the very sight of
them roused his hatred, and the having to pay them ransom stung
him to fury.&nbsp; All which is most natural and yet
unexpected.</p>
<p>The popular and genial Sir Frank Lockwood was almost the first
to put forward a plea in abatement of prejudice for the
firm.&nbsp; He showed that they were not much below the usual
type of middle-class solicitors.&nbsp; What they did was in the
ordinary course.&nbsp; With Mr. Pickwick they were most
forbearing, and even indulgent.&nbsp; There was one rather
doubtful passage, but even here he offers extenuation.&nbsp; This
was their treatment of poor Ramsey, which, at first sight, seems
very bad indeed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There was such a game with Fogg here, this
mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the man in the brown coat,
&lsquo;while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers, and you two
were gone to the stamp-office.&nbsp; Fogg was down here opening
the letters, when that chap we issued the writ against at <!--
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Camberwell, you know, came in&mdash;what&rsquo;s his
name again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ramsey,&rsquo; said the clerk who had spoken to Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Ramsey&mdash;a precious seedy-looking
customer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; says old Fogg, looking
at him very fierce&mdash;you know his way&mdash;&lsquo;well, Sir,
have you come to settle?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I have,
Sir,&rsquo; said Ramsey, putting his hand in his pocket, and
bringing out the money, &lsquo;the debt two-pound ten, and the
costs three pound five, and here it is, sir;&rsquo; and he sighed
like bricks, as he lugged out the money, done up in a bit of
blotting paper.&nbsp; Old Fogg looked first at the money, and
then at him, and then he coughed in his rum way, so that I knew
something was coming.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know
there&rsquo;s a declaration filed, which increases the costs
materially, I suppose?&rsquo; said Fogg.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
don&rsquo;t say that Sir,&rsquo; said Ramsey, starting back;
&lsquo;the time was only out last night, Sir.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I do say it, though,&rsquo; said Fogg, &lsquo;my
clerk&rsquo;s just gone to file it.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t Mr.
Jackson gone to file that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey, Mr.
Wicks?&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course I said yes, and then Fogg coughed
again, and looked at Ramsey.&nbsp; &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; said
Ramsey; &lsquo;and here have I nearly driven myself mad, scraping
this money together, and all to no purpose.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;None at all,&rsquo; said Fogg, coolly; &lsquo;so you had
better go back and scrape some more together, and bring it here
in time.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get it, by God,&rsquo;
said Ramsey, striking the desk with his fist.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bully me, Sir,&rsquo; said Fogg, getting into
a passion on purpose.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not bullying you,
Sir,&rsquo; said Ramsey.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are,&rsquo; said Fogg;
&lsquo;get out, Sir, get out of this office, Sir, and come back,
Sir, when you know how to behave yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well,
Ramsey tried to speak, but Fogg wouldn&rsquo;t let him, so he put
the money in his pocket, and sneaked out.&nbsp; The door was
scarcely shut, when old Fogg turned round to me, with a sweet
smile on <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>his face, and drew the declaration
out of his coat pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, Wicks,&rsquo; says
Fogg, &lsquo;take a cab, and go down to the Temple as quick as
you can, and file that.&nbsp; The costs are quite safe, for
he&rsquo;s a steady man with a large family, at a salary of
five-and-twenty shillings a week, and if he gives us a warrant of
attorney, as he must in the end, I know his employers will see it
paid; so we may as well get all we can out of him, Mr. Wicks;
it&rsquo;s a Christian act to do it, Mr. Wicks, for with his
large family and small income, he&rsquo;ll be all the better for
a good lesson against getting into debt,&mdash;won&rsquo;t he,
Mr. Wicks, won&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;&mdash;and he smiled so
goodnaturedly as he went away, that it was delightful to see
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a capital man of business,&rsquo; said
Wicks, in a tone of the deepest admiration, &lsquo;capital,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other three cordially subscribed to this opinion, and the
anecdote afforded the most unlimited satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nice men these here, Sir,&rsquo; whispered Mr. Weller
to his master; &lsquo;wery nice notion of fun they has,
Sir.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir F. Lockwood, by the way, offers one of the most amusing
proofs conceivable, of the convincing power of
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; which is constantly taking us out of the
world of fiction, into that of the daily living life.&nbsp; He
speaks of the cruel trick played upon the unfortunate Ramsey, who
came to pay his bill of costs, and was told that these were out
of date, had been swelled by subsequent proceedings.&nbsp; An
affidavit had been sworn&mdash;which, after he left the house,
Wicks, the clerk, was sent off to swear&mdash;Then, Sir Frank,
adds: &ldquo;After all, this is merely given <i>as the statement
of Wicks</i>&mdash;<i>on whose testimony not much reliance can be
placed</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As though Wicks were some living
witness, &ldquo;erect upon two legs,&rdquo; whom he had been
examining in Court!</p>
<p>It must, however, be recollected that this was an
<i>exparte</i> story.&nbsp; Wicks, as Sir F. Lockwood hints, may
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>have coloured it up, to amuse his brethren.&nbsp; The
truth is these poor helpless debtors, who fall into the hands of
legal &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; and money-lenders, have <i>their</i>
tricks also.&nbsp; They will often &ldquo;do&rdquo; those they
employ if they can.&nbsp; And further, let this be
considered.&nbsp; Before Ramsey paid his visit the affidavit
<i>had</i> been prepared, and was actually in Fogg&rsquo;s
pocket.&nbsp; Such affidavit would not be allowed for in the
costs unless necessary to the case, so that Fogg&rsquo;s
statement that it had been filed was very near the truth.&nbsp;
Perker himself was playing the same game of hide and seek with
another unfortunate&mdash;one Watty&mdash;who was trying to see
him, and learn something about his case, but was always put off
with the excuse or falsehood, that Perker was out, though he was
within.&nbsp; But then, &ldquo;Perker was an honourable
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boz lets us know, through Sam, how the case reached Dodson and
Fogg.&nbsp; He speaks of &ldquo;the kind generous people o&rsquo;
the perfession &rsquo;as sets their clerks to work to find out
little disputes among their neighbours and acquaintances as wants
settlin&rsquo; by means of law suits.&rdquo;&nbsp; This system,
however, cannot be checked, and &ldquo;the speculative
attorney&rdquo; even in our time still flourishes.</p>
<p>It was really not a question whether Mr. Pickwick would
&ldquo;indict them for a conspiracy,&rdquo; because they acted as
solicitors against him, but whether they would bring an action
against <i>him</i> on their own account.&nbsp; All through, Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s behaviour to them had been outrageous.&nbsp; He
chose to assume, quite gratuitously that it was they&mdash;not
Mrs. Bardell&mdash;who got up the case; that they had worked on
her for their own nefarious ends.&nbsp; Nothing could be more
absurd.&nbsp; The landlady was eager enough to protect her own
interests&mdash;her female friends worked on her, and the loss of
so valuable a lodger, which the incident must have entailed,
inflamed her more.&nbsp; We can see from Sam&rsquo;s interview
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>with her that she was at last, though at first
reluctant, determined to have her rights.&nbsp; But Mr. Pickwick
acting on this assumption addressed the firm, from the first to
the last in the most scurrilous language.&nbsp; He called them
&ldquo;robbers, swindlers,&mdash;a brace of pettifogging
scoundrels!&rdquo;&nbsp; Shocking and ungentlemanly terms, and
what is worse, actionable.&nbsp; Yet the pair received this abuse
with infinite good temper and restraint, merely securing a
witness who should listen, and threatening the speaker with legal
penalties.</p>
<p>And why did they not take this course?&nbsp; Well, they had to
suspend proceedings until Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s action was
settled, when on receiving their costs they were desirous to part
in good humour.&nbsp; But Mr. Pickwick was so furious at being
invited to shake hands with them, that he again broke out with
coarse abuse, &ldquo;Robbers!&rdquo; &ldquo;Robbers!&rdquo;
calling it after them down the stairs.&nbsp; Why did they not
take action on this?&nbsp; Perhaps they were afraid; as Mr.
Pickwick had shewn himself such a doughty and unyielding
fighter&mdash;going to prison rather than pay.&nbsp; Perhaps they
thought he might get the better of them again.</p>
<p>We have very little evidence as to what was the scale of fees
in use in these days.&nbsp; They were of course far lower than
they are now, after allowances even for the lower cost of
living.&nbsp; To-day, the fees to Counsel alone would have
absorbed considerably more than Dodson and Fogg&rsquo;s whole
bill of costs.&nbsp; A nice point is, could Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
irregular interview with Serjeant Snubbin be considered something
in the way of a consultation?&nbsp; Here were Counsel, Solicitor
and Client: the Serjeant gave up a portion of his valuable time
and, further, the junior counsel was summoned specially from his
chambers to supply his &ldquo;advice and opinion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Pickwick ought surely to have to pay for his whim.&nbsp; And
the bill of costs that these &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; of attornies
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>sent in!&nbsp; It was astonishingly moderate.&nbsp; For
writ, service of subp&oelig;nas, hunting up evidence,
consultation, fees to counsel, fees for the day, retainers,
etc.,&mdash;the sum of &pound;120 was all that was asked.</p>
<p>Imagine Messrs. Lewis and Lewis sending in such a demand at
the end of a trial which it had taken them nearly a year to get
ready.&nbsp; In our time it could hardly be done under
&pound;1,000.&nbsp; Perker, by the way, told his client that on
payment of the costs both of Plaintiff and Defendent, into the
hands of &ldquo;these sharks&rdquo; he would get his
release.&nbsp; With much indulgence&mdash;the
attornies&mdash;allowed him to leave the prison on his bare
undertaking to pay.&nbsp; And it is not clear why he should pay
his own costs to them, and not to Perker.&nbsp; And they were
<i>not</i> paid for sometime.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s own
costs must have been small.&nbsp; He had no witnesses.&nbsp;
Perker would not have made a hand of him, and I fancy he would
have got off for ninety pounds, or a hundred pounds.&nbsp; There
was, however, the fees of the Special Jury, so he would have to
pay, say, &pound;220.</p>
<h2><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>THE COGNOVIT.</h2>
<p>Perker, it has been shown, was not a very brilliant solicitor,
and his views on the trial were somewhat cloudy.&nbsp; When he
was urging his client to leave the Fleet he threw out some
equally shadowy and ill-informed notions as to what might be done
in the way of punishing the nefarious solicitors, Dodson and
Fogg, &ldquo;those Freeman&rsquo;s Court Sharks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His great charge was that they had got a <i>cognovit</i>, or
undertaking to pay their costs out of Mrs. Bardell&mdash;their
own client!&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick refused to pay them&mdash;why
should not she?&nbsp; The poor woman had &ldquo;blabbed&rdquo; to
Sam, a careless and natural assurance of theirs, that they would
be content to get them from Mr. Pickwick&mdash;a thing many a
firm would do.&nbsp; But Perker here sees a regular
conspiracy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot undertake to say whether the
wording of the cognovit, the nature of the ostensible
consideration and the proof we can get together about the whole
conduct of the suit, <i>will be sufficient to justify an
indictment for conspiracy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to understand this bit of legal jargon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wording of the cognovit&rdquo;&mdash;one could
speculate on <i>that</i> without seeing it.&nbsp; (2) &ldquo;The
nature of the ostensible consideration&rdquo; was not far to
seek&mdash;it being work and labour done for the Plaintiff.&nbsp;
And again, supposing they had promised her to get them solely
from Mr. Pickwick&mdash;Sam&rsquo;s revelation of this, in open
court, and its reception with laughter, showed what was thought
of it.&nbsp; So which of the two courses were they <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>to
adopt?&nbsp; (3) And &ldquo;the proof we may get together about
the whole conduct of the suit.&rdquo;&nbsp; This &ldquo;whole
conduct&rdquo; was perfectly regular.&nbsp; So the Judge
thought&mdash;so did the jury.&nbsp; The case was proved by
Pickwick&rsquo;s own friends.&nbsp; As we know, however, the firm
took no steps to obtain satisfaction, but there cannot be the
slightest doubt that they would have &ldquo;recovered
damages.&rdquo;&nbsp; We doubt if Mr. Pickwick would have gone to
the Fleet for the second time rather than pay.</p>
<p>Perker&rsquo;s suspicions as to the <i>Cognovit</i> obtained
by Dodson and Fogg were shrewd, and certain enough, though he
could not have seen the document.&nbsp; The suspicions were well
warranted by the state of the Law, which became an instrument in
the hands of grasping attorneys.&nbsp; By it the client was made
to sign an acknowledgment, and offering no defence to a supposed
action,&mdash;say for costs&mdash;brought against him, Judgment
was then marked.</p>
<p>This offered a great temptation to the unscrupulous.&nbsp;
Mrs. Bardell, no doubt, signed with light heart, not knowing what
she was doing, and being told that it was merely a matter of
form.&nbsp; Various enactments attempted to protect the
client&mdash;one being passed some four or five years before the
trial Bardell v. Pickwick, requiring the <i>Cognovit</i> to be
regularly filed within twenty-one days; more than ten years later
it was required, that the client&rsquo;s signing such a thing
should have no force in Law, unless he was represented by another
solicitor.</p>
<p>The matter, as we know, was compromised with Dodson and Fogg,
so there was no need to scrutinize the <i>Cognovit</i>.&nbsp; No
doubt Perker was enabled to put pressure on the firm by hinting
at such proceedings.</p>
<p>The damages, &pound;750, were certainly moderate, and would
not have been reduced by the Court on an application to set them
aside as &ldquo;excessive.&rdquo;&nbsp; The good woman was quite
at her ease, being no doubt certain <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>that Mr.
Pickwick, at last, must give in.&nbsp; She could even enjoy the
society of her friends and make the celebrated junketting to the
&ldquo;Spaniards.&rdquo;&nbsp; The firm took another view and
grew tired of waiting; or they were sagacious enough to see that
the arrest of their client was about the best method of putting
pressure on Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; In this connection, it may be
noted that Jackson&rsquo;s over zeal in the transaction might
have led to an action against his employers; for he arrested not
only Mrs. Bardell, but her friends, Mrs. Sanders and Mrs.
Cluppins.&nbsp; The prison gates were actually shut on
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Safe and sound,&rdquo; said the Bailiff.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here we are at last,&rdquo; said Jackson, &ldquo;all right
and tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True, Mrs. Bardell put under her hand in her appealing letter
to Mr. Pickwick, that &ldquo;this business was from the very
first fomented and encouraged and brought about by these
men,&rdquo; but this is not much; for the view only occurs to her
when her operations had completely failed and recoiled on her own
head with such disastrous result.&nbsp; The firm&rsquo;s business
was to persuade her that she had a good case, and the
Jury&rsquo;s verdict proved that she had.&nbsp; Had Mr. Pickwick
given in and paid, she would have had no scruples.&nbsp; One
cannot, at the same time, but admire the ingenuity of the author,
in bringing such a Nemesis on her.&nbsp; Dodson and Fogg, we are
told, &ldquo;continue in business from which they realise a large
income, and in which they are universally considered among the
sharpest of the sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the last interview, at Perker&rsquo;s, when the costs were
paid, one might have expected Mr. Pickwick to behave with a
certain disdainful dignity.&nbsp; He was beaten and had paid over
the stakes, and could afford to treat his enemy with
contempt.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; The partners held out the olive
branch by alluding to the way they had passed by his unmannerly
attacks on them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg to assure you, sir, I bear
you no ill will or vindictive feeling for <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>sentiments
you thought proper to express of us in our office,&rdquo; and the
other partner said, &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think quite so
ill of us, etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was rather gentlemanly and
becoming.&nbsp; One offered his hand.&nbsp; But Mr. Pickwick
broke out in a perfect fury.&nbsp; They had assumed a tone of
forgiveness which was &ldquo;an excess of impudence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had been &ldquo;the victim of their plots and
conspiracies.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had imprisoned and robbed
him.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;insolent familiarity.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
last he said, &ldquo;<i>You are a well-matched pair of mean</i>,
<i>rascally</i>, <i>pettifogging robbers</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
sentence he repeated three times, and the words
&ldquo;Robbers&rdquo; he shouted after them many times over the
stairs.</p>
<p>Sharping attornies!&nbsp; Why, a real sharping firm would have
forced from their client advances of fee, &ldquo;cash out of
pocket,&rdquo; have made her give a Bill of Sale on her lease and
goods, and have fairly stripped her of everything before the case
began.&nbsp; Of the damages&mdash;had they got them&mdash;she
would have seen but little.</p>
<p>The <i>Cognovit</i> that was extracted from Mrs. Bardell was
an acknowledgement, as we have seen, which entitled them to enter
up judgment just as if a trial had taken place.&nbsp; In the
Oxford great Dictionary, it reads quaintly to find Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s cognovit quoted as an illustration of the legal
meaning.</p>
<p>The Turnkey, on her arrest, had told Sam that she had been
brought to the Fleet, &ldquo;on a Cognovit for costs,&rdquo; Sam
imparted this news to Job Trotter, and sent him off, hot foot, to
Perker in Montague Place.&nbsp; This outcast, was able to tell
him, &ldquo;it seems they got a <i>Cognovit</i> out of her for
the amount of the costs, directly after the trial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boz, on this occasion, gives us a happy glimpse of Solicitor
life.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Perker had a dinner party that day, which was
certified by the lights in the drawing-room windows, the sound of
an improved grand piano, and an improveable cabinet voice issuing
therefrom; <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>and a rather overpowering smell of
meat which prevaded the steps and entry.&nbsp; In fact, a couple
of very good country agencies happening to come up to town at the
same time, an agreeable little party had been got together to
meet them, comprising Mr. Snicks the Life Office Secretary, Mr.
Prosee the eminent counsel, three solicitors, one commissioner of
bankrupts, a special pleader from the Temple, a small-eyed
peremptory young gentleman, his pupil, who had written a lively
book about the law of demises, with a vast quantity of marginal
notes and references; and several other eminent and distinguished
personages.&nbsp; From this society little Mr. Perker detached
himself on his clerk being announced in a whisper; and repairing
to the dining-room, there found Mr. Lowten and Job Trotter
looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle,
which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts
and cottons for a quarterly stipend, had, with a becoming
contempt for the clerk and all things appertaining to &lsquo;the
office,&rsquo; placed upon the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Lowten,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker, shutting the
door, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; No important letter
come in a parcel, is there?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do we not seem to be present?&nbsp; We can never pass by
Russell Square without calling up the scene.&nbsp; Note, too, the
components of that legal dinner.&nbsp; Poor Sir F. Lockwood used
to declare that he relished &ldquo;Mr. Prosee, the eminent
counsel,&rdquo; more than any one of Boz&rsquo;s legal
circle.&nbsp; Yet these five words are all we know of him.&nbsp;
But Sir Frank had imagination, and like some of us could read
between the lines, or rather, between the words.&nbsp; Here was a
prominent member of the Bar&mdash;was he K.C.? a triton among the
minnows&mdash;therefore heading the table, listened to with
reverence as he told of the judges, possibly of &ldquo;old
Stareleigh&rsquo;s&rdquo; last exhibition of
petulance&mdash;&ldquo;with it&rsquo;s high time for him to go,
etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>he had not
silk, why did not Perker retain him instead of the incapable
Phunky, whom he did <i>not</i> ask on this occasion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I gave the chap a good chance, but he destroyed my whole
case!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Catch me letting him put his legs under
my mahogany.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the guests was that
&ldquo;small-eyed, peremptory young gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;the
special pleader&rsquo;s pupil.&nbsp; What a capital sketch has
Boz given of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had written a <i>lively</i>
book about the law of demises, with a vast quantity of marginal
notes and references.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had come with his teacher,
who was no doubt highly deferental to Mr. Prosee, but enough, the
peremptory young gentleman may have partly &ldquo;tackled&rdquo;
the great man on some point of practice.&nbsp; The good country
agencies must have gone home delighted with their evening.</p>
<p>But Mr. Prosee may be brought into somewhat closer
communication with the case.&nbsp; At Perker&rsquo;s dinner the
gentlemen had gone up to the drawing room, when Perker was called
down to hear the news of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s arrest.&nbsp; Mr.
Prosee was left expatiating to the circle on some beautiful
&ldquo;point,&rdquo; and when Perker returned how likely that he
should tell of his extraordinary client who had preferred to go
to prison rather than pay the costs of a suit, &ldquo;and
here,&rdquo; he would go on, &ldquo;is the drollest sequel you
ever heard, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An odd unusual thing,&rdquo; Mr. Prosee would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Plaintiff and Defendant, both in jail
together!&nbsp; I never heard the like.&rdquo;&nbsp; There would
be much laughter at the novel situation.&nbsp; Thus the
<i>cognovit</i> would come up and Mr. Prosee gravely say,
&ldquo;nothing will be done till an Act of Parliament is
passed.&nbsp; The client should be protected by a fresh
solicitor.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which the young author of the treatise
on Demises would have something to say in his best fashion; for
the <i>cognovit</i> might be taken to be a sort of demise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I doubt Mr. Prosee, if your suggestion would work.&nbsp;
As I take it, sir, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>RELEASE FROM THE FLEET.</h2>
<p>But the circumstances connected with Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
release from the Fleet, show the adroitness and ability of Dodson
in a high degree.&nbsp; It will be recollected that when Job
rushed with the news to Perker, that gentleman and his clerk
broke out into raptuous admiration.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Now, Lowten,&rsquo; said little Mr. Perker,
shutting the door, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; No
important letter come in a parcel, is there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; replied Lowten.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a
messenger from Mr. Pickwick, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Pickwick, eh?&rsquo; said the little man, turning
quickly to Job.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well; what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dodson and Fogg have taken Mrs. Bardell in execution
for her costs, sir,&rsquo; said Job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; exclaimed Perker, putting his hands in his
pockets, and reclining against the sideboard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Job.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seems they got a
cognovit out of her for the amount of &rsquo;em, directly after
the trial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; said Perker, taking both hands out of
his pockets and striking the knuckles of his right against the
palm of his left, emphatically, &lsquo;those are the cleverest
scamps I ever had anything to do with!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sharpest practitioners <i>I</i> ever knew,
sir,&rsquo; observed Lowten.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sharp!&rsquo; echoed Perker.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
no knowing where to have them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very true, sir, there is not,&rsquo; replied Lowten;
and then both master and man pondered for a few seconds, <!--
page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>with animated countenances, as if they were reflecting
upon one of the most beautiful and ingenious discoveries that the
intellect of man had ever made.&nbsp; When they had in some
measure recovered from their trance of admiration, Job Trotter
discharged himself of the rest of his commission.&nbsp; Perker
nodded his head thoughtfully, and pulled out his watch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now to the superficial this seemed to be evaded by the art of
the firm in &ldquo;getting the cognovit out of her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But this was an ordinary, vulgar stroke&mdash;which anyone could
have done.&nbsp; Their policy went far deeper, and this Perker
was acute enough to recognize.&nbsp; There was no object in
putting Mrs. Bardell into the Fleet.</p>
<p>They could no more get their costs out of her, than they could
get them out of Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; She had nothing but her few
&ldquo;sticks&rdquo; of furniture, worth say &pound;50.&nbsp; But
the astute fellows saw what pressure could be put on the
benevolent nature of Mr. Pickwick, who could not endure that a
respectable woman should be exposed to the contamination of a
debtor&rsquo;s prison.&nbsp; And their sagacity was to be
justified, and on the very next day, too.</p>
<p>It is curious, however, that no mention is made of Mrs.
Bardell&rsquo;s release.&nbsp; It, of course, took place before
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here again Dodson and Fogg behaved
very fairly, for they allowed both her and Mr. Pickwick to be
released, without receiving payment, but simply on &ldquo;an
understanding&rdquo; by Perker.&nbsp; As it turned out, indeed,
they were not paid for some weeks.</p>
<p>The processes by which Mr. Pickwick was got into the Fleet
were complicated enough, <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, appearing before
functionaries, etc.&nbsp; But it is odd that in cases of persons
of lower degree these seemed not to be necessary.&nbsp; We do not
hear of them in Sam&rsquo;s instance.&nbsp; While Mrs. Bardell,
was taken straight from &ldquo;the Spaniards,&rdquo; to the
prison door, she was not even <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>formally
arrested by the Bailiff, though he was in attendance.&nbsp; He
sat afar off at Hampstead, taking his drink&mdash;and on the box
during the drive.&nbsp; She might be said to have been
arbitrarily taken to the prison by Jackson&mdash;without a legal
warrant.&nbsp; Had not the business been compromised, some other
astute firm of attorneys might have found subject for an action
against Dodson and Fogg.</p>
<p>Another of the humorous incidents connected with the case is
old Weller&rsquo;s firm persuasion that Mr. Pickwick was to
&ldquo;stand his trial,&rdquo; as though he were indicted for
some criminal offence.&nbsp; We find him always astray as to when
he was to be &ldquo;tried,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; This is a most
natural impression among the lower classes, who are not very
clear as to the distinction between civil and criminal process,
being most familiar with the latter.&nbsp; In the same spirit is
his humorous suggestion of securing an <i>alibi</i>, as the best
method of getting Mr. Pickwick off.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Sammy, Sammy,
vy worn&rsquo;t there a alleybi!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Such is &ldquo;The Trial in Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is there any writer, now living, I may be asked, who could
furnish such a picture as this, one so full of reality and true
humour, of one of our modern Courts of Justice?&nbsp; The answer
must be that it would be idle to look for such a person.&nbsp;
There are thousands who could supply minute drawings in which not
a single detail would be omitted.&nbsp; But the piercing to the
essence, the happy generalization, the knowledge of the true
points of character, these would be sought in vain.</p>
<h2>Footnotes:</h2>
<p><a name="footnote26"></a><a href="#citation26"
class="footnote">[26]</a>&nbsp; So confused is the chronology of
<i>Pickwick</i>, that it is difficult to fix the exact date of
the Trial.&nbsp; Boz, writing some ten years after the event,
seems to have got a little confused and uncertain as to the exact
year of the Trial.&nbsp; He first fixed the opening of the story
in 1817: but on coming to the compromising incident in Goswell
Street, which occurred only a few weeks later, he changed the
year to 1827.&nbsp; Then Jingle&rsquo;s anachronism of the French
Revolution of July suggested that the new date would not
do.&nbsp; So 1830 was next adopted.&nbsp; But this did not end
the matter, for in the &ldquo;errata&rdquo; we are directed to
change this date back again to 1827.&nbsp; And so it now
stands.&nbsp; The Trial therefore really took place on April 1,
1828.</p>
<p><a name="footnote84"></a><a href="#citation84"
class="footnote">[84]</a>&nbsp; Seven years after the Trial this
monopoly was taken away from the Serjeants&mdash;namely in 1834:
then capriciously given back to them, and finally abolished in
1840.</p>
<p><a name="footnote85"></a><a href="#citation85"
class="footnote">[85]</a>&nbsp; I have heard from the daughter of
Mr. Chapman, the original publisher of <i>Pickwick</i>, that
Talfourd revised and directed the &ldquo;Trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
one occasion Boz was dining with him when the proof was brought
in, with some legal mistakes noted by Talfourd.&nbsp; Boz left
the table and put it right.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
